# Kerf vs 3Shape Dental System

3Shape Dental System is the dominant dental CAD platform for dental laboratories worldwide. It covers the full range of dental restorations: AI-assisted crown and bridge design, implant planning against a library of 100+ implant systems, removable partial dentures, full dentures, orthodontic clear aligners, occlusal splints, and surgical guides — all integrated with 3Shape's TRIOS intraoral scanner and 3Shape Produce manufacturing output. It is a dedicated dental technology platform. Kerf's dental module covers DICOM ingest, surgical guide geometry, anatomic crown design (swept margin polygon with cusp ridges), parametric full-denture and RPD connector geometry, and STL export for milling. Kerf's value in dental is multi-domain: combining dental geometry with structural FEA, materials LCA, and biomedical engineering in one workspace.

## Where 3Shape is strong

- **Restoration design depth.** 3Shape's crown and bridge tools include AI design proposals via 3Shape Automate (~90 seconds to a clinically reasonable starting point), virtual articulator, screw-retained and standard crown options, and post/core abutment design. Kerf's CrownSculptingPanel provides parametric sculpting with preset + sliders but no AI proposals or virtual articulator.
- **100+ implant library.** Every major implant system's geometry, connection, and scan body. Kerf's ImplantLibrary ships representative entries for 4 manufacturers — not a certified clinical library.
- **Denture and RPD.** Full denture (complete and implant-retained) and removable partial denture design — major restorative categories that Kerf has no tooling for.
- **3Shape Produce / manufacturing.** Direct integration with dental mills (Sirona, Roland, Datron) and 3D printers; click-to-manufacture workflow. Kerf exports STL; no dental mill post processor.
- **TRIOS scanner ecosystem.** Native integration with one of the leading intraoral scanners plus support for third-party IOS formats. Kerf has no scanner integration.
- **Purpose-built dental AI.** 3Shape Automate's AI is trained on dental anatomy and produces clinically appropriate restoration proposals. Kerf's LLM-routed tool calls are general-purpose, not dental-specific.

## Where Kerf differs

- **MIT open-core.** 3Shape licensing is per-seat, per-module (not publicly listed; typically thousands per year per module). Kerf is MIT-licensed — free locally.
- **DICOM ingest.** Kerf has a DICOM ingest module for CBCT processing. 3Shape also supports DICOM, but Kerf's open DICOM pipeline can integrate with custom research and biomedical workflows.
- **Multi-domain workspace.** A biomedical engineer can combine Kerf's dental tools with structural FEA of a restorative implant system, materials LCA for biocompatible ceramics, and additive manufacturing simulation in one project. 3Shape is dental-only.
- **Chat-native.** Describe a restoration requirement in plain language; Kerf routes to the dental backend. 3Shape has no LLM interface.
- **Python scripting.** kerf-sdk on PyPI for dental tool automation. 3Shape has a limited API; not Python-native.

## Honest gaps — where Kerf is behind today

- **Crown anatomy is parametric, not AI-guided.** CrownSculptingPanel provides preset picker + sliders + occlusion overlay + backend dispatch. The backend sweeps the margin polygon with raised-cosine cusp ridges (2 cusps for premolars, 4 for molars). It is not clinically tuned to patient occlusion, does not include a virtual articulator, and does not produce a bridge pontic.
- **Implant library is representative, not certified.** ImplantLibrary ships Straumann, Nobel Biocare, Zimmer, and MIS entries with real diameter/length ranges and connection types. It is not a certified clinical library — it does not include every SKU or proprietary scan-body geometry.
- **Surgical guide is preview-only in the UI.** SurgicalGuide dispatches to the backend and renders an SVG sleeve preview. It does not produce a milling-ready guide body (no B-rep or 3MF output from the UI layer).
- **Denture is geometry, not fit-optimised.** The full denture and RPD connector are parametric arch meshes. There is no residual-ridge scan registration, no mucosal relief, and no occlusal balance.
- **No scanner integration.** No way to import an intraoral scan directly from a TRIOS or third-party IOS. Full IOS pipeline (multi-scan alignment, deviation map) is an epic.
- **No dental-specific AI.** Kerf's general LLM is not trained on dental anatomy.
- **No dental mill post processor.** Can export STL; cannot generate G-code for Sirona, Roland, or Datron dental mills.
