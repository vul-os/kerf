"""
kerf_core.workers.compaction_worker — background revision-chain compaction.

Polls ``file_revisions`` for chains that have accumulated more than
COMPACTION_THRESHOLD diff rows without a base.  For each such chain the
worker:

1. Reconstructs the full content at the chain tip.
2. Writes a new ``base`` row (gzip-compressed, SHA-256 hash populated).
3. Deletes the now-redundant intermediate diff rows — but only rows that
   are not referenced as ``parent_revision_id`` by any other row and are
   not themselves ``base`` rows (cross-file ``ref`` targets are also
   protected; see Part 2 logic in revisions.py).

This worker is **server-mode-only**: ``local_mode=False``.

OSS local-install users have small revision sets (revision cap default
200) that never need background compaction. Any node running in server
mode (a shared team box or an always-on node) benefits regardless of
whether it's operated by its owner or by a third party — there is no
separate "cloud tier" any more. Gating is the caller's responsibility;
the worker itself will raise ``RuntimeError`` at ``__init__`` if
instantiated in local mode.

Schedule / cadence: poll every ``poll_interval`` seconds (default 300 s,
i.e. every 5 minutes).  One chain is compacted per ``run_one`` call;
subsequent iterations drain the backlog naturally.

Idempotent: if a chain is already short (≤ COMPACTION_THRESHOLD diffs)
it is skipped.  Re-running on an already-compacted chain is harmless.
