# Local / self-host install

Kerf can run entirely on your own machine. This page covers what you get, what you need, and how to configure it.

---

## What you get

A self-hosted Kerf install is the full MIT codebase. There is no feature difference from Kerf Cloud for design capabilities:

- Every CAD tool: JSCAD, OCCT B-rep, sketcher, assemblies, drawings, GD&T
- Electronics / PCB design
- FEM, CAM, 3D-print slicing, topology optimisation
- All LLM agent tools (~150 tools across 19 plugins)
- [File revision history and undo](./file-revisions.md)
- Parts library capability (you fetch the data yourself — see [oss-cloud-separation.md §4](./oss-cloud-separation.md))

What is not present in a self-hosted install (cloud-only-by-nature surfaces):
- Hosted billing / usage metering
- The operator-run Workshop public gallery
- Hosted git + GitHub sync
- Operator distributor sweep (configurable with your own credentials)
- Transactional email

See [cloud-features.md](./cloud-features.md) for the full comparison.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (in a virtualenv)
- **Postgres 14+** — Kerf uses Postgres even locally. No SQLite path exists.
- **Node 20+** (only needed if you build the frontend from source)

---

## Install

### From PyPI (recommended)

```sh
pip install kerf[mech]          # mechanical CAD stack
# or
pip install kerf[electronics]   # EDA stack
# or
pip install kerf[full]          # everything (includes cloud plugins — needs KERF_CLOUD=1 to activate)
```

Persona options: `api-only`, `mech`, `electronics`, `bim`, `full`, `compute-only`.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kerf-design/kerf
cd kerf
pip install -e .[mech]       # or another persona
npm install && npm run build  # build the frontend
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the example config and edit it:

```sh
cp kerf.example.toml kerf.toml
```

Minimum config for a local single-user install:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080

[database]
url = "postgres://your_pg_user@localhost:5432/kerf?sslmode=disable"

[auth]
local_mode = true            # skip all auth — single-user
jwt_secret = "change-me-random-string"

[storage]
backend = "filesystem"
filesystem_root = "~/kerf-projects"
```

With `local_mode = true`:
- All authentication is bypassed. The login UI is hidden.
- `POST /auth/bootstrap-local` issues a session for the configured local user.
- All requests resolve to that user.
- The `filesystem` storage backend writes each project as a directory under `filesystem_root`, so your JSCAD / STEP files are real files you can open, grep, and git from outside the app.

---

## Database setup

```sh
createdb kerf                # create the database
kerf-server --migrate        # apply all OSS migrations
```

If you are running the `full` persona with `KERF_CLOUD=1`:

```sh
KERF_CLOUD=1 kerf-server --migrate   # also applies cloud-only migrations
```

---

## Starting the server

```sh
kerf-server --config ./kerf.toml
```

Or with env vars:

```sh
KERF_DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." kerf-server
```

The server binds to `host:port` as configured. The frontend SPA is served from the same port. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

---

## LLM provider keys

Self-hosted installs use provider API keys directly — there is no Kerf billing layer.

Set keys in `kerf.toml`:

```toml
[llm]
anthropic_api_key = "sk-ant-..."
openai_api_key    = "sk-..."
```

Or via environment variables:

```toml
[llm]
# leave blank — the server reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY from env
```

With `local_mode = true` and `AUTH_OPTIONAL = true`, you can also let users paste their own keys through the settings panel (`prefer_byo` in the BYO model — see [billing-and-credits.md](./billing-and-credits.md#byo-bring-your-own-keys)).

---

## Parts library

The parts library works self-hosted. You populate it yourself.

### Standard mechanical parts (MIT, no external data)

```sh
pip install -e packages/kerf-partsgen
python -m kerf_partsgen.cli enumerate    # generate geometry into ./.parts-out/
python -m kerf_partsgen.cli seed         # upsert into the Parts Library project
```

### Third-party libraries (KiCad, BOLTS, FreeCAD-library)

```sh
pip install -e "packages/kerf-parts[seed]"
kerf-parts-fetch            # fetch from upstream into ./.parts-cache/ (gitignored)
kerf-parts-fetch --heavy    # also pull kicad-packages3D (multi-GB, opt-in)
kerf-seed-parts             # convert + upsert
```

## Persona bundles

A persona is a named set of plugin packages. Select one at install time:

| Persona | Plugins included |
|---|---|
| `api-only` | Core API + auth |
| `mech` | CAD, imports, mates, tess, parts, render, workers |
| `electronics` | Everything in mech + electronics, PCB, wiring, EDA |
| `bim` | Everything in mech + BIM, structural |
| `full` | Everything + cloud plugins (kerf-billing, kerf-cloud, kerf-pricing) |
| `compute-only` | Heavy compute plugins only (FEM, CAM, topo, render) — for a sidecar deploy |

With the `full` persona installed, cloud plugins are present but **dormant** unless you set `KERF_CLOUD=1` (or `cloud_enabled = true` in `kerf.toml`). You can run `full` without `KERF_CLOUD=1` and get the complete OSS feature set.

---

## Maintenance commands

```sh
kerf-server --migrate                   # run pending migrations
kerf-server revisions repack            # backfill gzip storage for file revisions
kerf-server revisions repack --dry-run  # preview without writing
kerf-server library-import --manifest samples/libraries/adafruit-sensors.yaml
```
