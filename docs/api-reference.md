# API reference

All routes are mounted under `/api` by `kerf-core`. The router is defined in
`packages/kerf-api/src/kerf_api/routes.py`; auth routes live in
`packages/kerf-auth/src/kerf_auth/routes.py`.

## Authentication

Kerf uses two token types carried in standard HTTP cookies:

| Cookie | Type | TTL |
|--------|------|-----|
| `access_token` | HS256 JWT (`sub` = user UUID) | `jwt_access_ttl_minutes` (default 15 min) |
| `refresh_token` | opaque `secrets.token_urlsafe(64)` | `jwt_refresh_ttl_days` (default 30 days) |

For SDK / headless access, long-lived opaque **API tokens** are issued per
workspace and carried in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

Every endpoint that requires auth is guarded by `require_auth` from
`kerf_core.dependencies`. Endpoints that accept anonymous access for public
projects use `optional_auth`. Role enforcement (`owner` / `admin` / `member` /
`viewer`) happens inside each handler via `get_user_workspace_role`.

a personal workspace on first login.

Roles: `owner` > `admin` > `member`.

| PATCH | `/api/workspaces/{slug}` | required | admin |
| DELETE | `/api/workspaces/{slug}` | required | owner |
| POST | `/api/workspaces/accept` | required | — (invite token) |
| GET | `/api/workspaces/avatar/{id}` | none | — |

## Files

Files are the leaf nodes of the project tree. A `folder` is a file with
`kind='folder'` and no content. Files are soft-deleted (`deleted_at`); bytes
are retained until a purge pass.

| DELETE | `/api/projects/{pid}/files/{fid}` | required | member |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/files/{fid}/download` | required | member |

## Workshop

Public project gallery, backed by DMTAP-PUB (see
[distributed-workshop.md](./distributed-workshop.md)). No license or config
flag gates it — every node mounts these endpoints; whether anything is
actually published or fetched depends on the node's own toggles and the
user's explicit publish/follow actions.

## Health and capabilities

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GET | `/health` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| GET | `/health/capabilities` | Union of all loaded plugin `provides` lists + per-plugin metadata |

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | OK |
| 201 | Created |
| 204 | No content (DELETE success) |
| 400 | Bad request — malformed input, validation failure |
| 401 | Unauthenticated — missing or expired token |
| 403 | Forbidden — authenticated but insufficient role |
| 404 | Not found (also returned instead of 403 on resource isolation) |
| 409 | Conflict — slug collision, duplicate entry |
| 410 | Gone — share link exhausted |
| 500 | Unexpected server error |

Tool-call errors inside the agent loop never return 500 — they return
`{"error": "…", "code": "…"}` JSON that the LLM can inspect.
