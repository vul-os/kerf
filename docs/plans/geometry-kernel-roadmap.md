> (Coons), GK-36 (curvature refvalues), GK-58/59/60/61/62 (history
> DAG + persistent naming + evaluators), GK-66 (Euler-operator
> property suite). Remaining P0/P1 long-tail items, and the entire
> P2 interop block, stay checked unchecked in §4 below.

Single source of truth for closing the geometry-kernel depth gap. Subsequent
agents pull one `GK-NN` task at a time, isolate it in a worktree, ship a green
PR, tick the checkbox. Same discipline as `docs/plans/testing-breakdown.md`.

Ground rules for every task:

- Hermetic, pure-Python unless the task is explicitly an OCCT-worker task.
  No network, no external binaries in the unit tests.
- Every task has an **analytic oracle**: a closed-form quantity (exact circle
  radius, exact offset distance, Hausdorff bound, residual = 0) that the test
  asserts. "Looks plausible" is not an oracle.
- One commit per task: `feat(geom): <one-line>` or `fix(geom): <one-line>`.
- Build on the **frozen `geom/BREP_CONTRACT.md`**. Do not change the entity
  class names, constructor signatures, Euler-operator signatures, the
  `{"ok","errors"}` shape, or the invariant. Add new modules/functions.
- The benchmark bar: **Rhino 8 / OpenNURBS** for comprehensiveness and
  analysis parity; **Parasolid / ACIS** for solid-modelling robustness
  expectations (valid topology out of every boolean, deterministic tolerant
  sewing, no "invalid solid" dead-ends).

---

## 1. Executive honest assessment

### What the kernel genuinely does well today

- **NURBS curve core is solid** (`geom/nurbs.py`): correct de Boor evaluation,
  knot insertion, Boehm/Oslo refinement, Tiller knot removal with the exact
  removal test, degree elevation, Forrest–Piegl degree reduction with a
  deviation gate, curve/surface split with full-multiplicity reinsertion,
  reparameterisation, and a **correct rational derivative** via the
  homogeneous quotient rule (`rational_curve_derivative`). This is real,
  not a toy.
- **Surface construction breadth is wide**: loft/skin (`network_srf.py`),
  `sweep1`/`sweep2` with twist + variable scale, `revolve_srf` (true arc
  control points, not faceted), `patch_srf`/`drape`/`heightfield`,
  `match_srf` with G0/G1/G2 application and a deviation classifier. On
  *coverage of construction verbs* Kerf is already close to Rhino.
- **Analysis breadth is wide** (`surface_analysis.py`): Gaussian/mean
  curvature, draft-angle, surface deviation, naked-edge, edge-continuity
  report, isocurve extraction, area/centroid/second moment. `make2d.py`
  (hidden-line), `section_contour.py` (section/silhouette/isoline),
  `unroll_srf.py` (developable + non-developable smash), `mesh_repair.py`
  (weld/unify/fill/decimate/QEM/mesh-boolean) are all present and broad.
- **The new `geom/brep.py` topology model is genuinely good**: a proper
  radial-edge-ish hierarchy, the generalised Euler–Poincaré invariant
  *enforced and re-checked*, nine Euler operators with exact inverses,
  primitive B-reps, and a six-point structural/manifold/tolerance
  `validate_body`. The contract is frozen and clean. This is the keystone
  the rest of the roadmap is built on. **Do not put the contract itself on
  the roadmap — it is done and good.**

### The honest gap: breadth without depth or topology binding

Kerf has *Rhino-width* construction verbs but **none of them produce a
topological B-rep**, and the numerical cores are sampling-grade, not
kernel-grade. The new `brep.py` exists but **is imported by nothing in
production** (only its contract doc and tests reference it — verified by
grep across `packages/kerf-cad-core/src`). Every surfacing verb returns a
bare `NurbsSurface`; every solid/boolean is *delegated to the OCCT worker*
via `.feature` nodes in `surfacing.py` (`to_solid`, `boolean`,
`surface_boolean`). The pure-Python layer cannot today produce, validate,
or round-trip a trimmed solid by itself.

### Top 10 robustness / comprehensiveness gaps, ranked by user impact

1. **No history / parametric regeneration.** `.feature` files are append-only
   node lists executed by the worker; there is no in-process feature tree,
   no dependency graph, no regenerate-on-edit, no persistent face naming
   feeding a rebuild. Rhino has History; Kerf has a write-only log. *Highest
   user impact: every edit is destructive.*
2. **`brep.py` is unwired.** Construction verbs and booleans do not emit
   `Body`/`Face`/`Edge`; `validate_body` guards nothing real. The topology
   keystone is load-bearing on paper only.
3. **Tolerant booleans have no topology and are delegated.**
   `surface_boolean_robust.py` is a *health-check + tolerance-ladder
   wrapper around an injected `occ_fn`* — with `occ_fn=None` it returns
   `result=None`. There is no pure-Python boolean that produces a valid
   `Body`. Parasolid/ACIS guarantee a valid solid out; Kerf currently
   guarantees nothing without OCCT.
4. **No point inversion / closest-point.** Grep confirms no
   `closest_point`/`point_inversion` on `NurbsCurve` or `NurbsSurface`.
   Only a finite-difference Newton UV-projection buried in
   `trim_curve._project_point_to_uv`. Closest-point is the primitive that
   *everything* (snapping, projection, deviation, SSI seeding, fitting,
   draft) should be built on; its absence forces every consumer to
   re-implement a worse version.
5. **SSI is sampling-grade and weak on hard branches.**
   `intersection.surface_surface_intersect` is grid-seed + tangent-march
   with finite-difference partials. It will miss/merge tangential
   intersections, mishandle closed loops (heuristic `step*3` closure test),
   small loops below grid resolution, and singular points. Rhino's SSI is
   the bedrock of trimming and booleans.
6. **No analytic curve↔surface derivatives for surfaces.**
   `surface_derivative` is *finite-difference only* (`h=1e-5`), and the
   non-rational `curve_derivative` wrongly normalises its result (noted in
   the code itself — `rational_curve_derivative` exists precisely because of
   this bug). FD derivatives cap curvature/continuity/fillet accuracy.
7. **Fillets are not G1/G2 and not topological.** `surface_fillet.py`
   builds a rolling-ball rail + arc cross-section surface; it does not
   enforce tangency (G1) or curvature (G2) continuity to the supports, does
   not trim the supports, and does not produce a sewn body. No edge/vertex
   blend, no setback, no variable-radius with continuity.
8. **No fitting/approximation to a tolerance with knot placement.**
   `fit_curve` brute-forces control-point count with uniform knots; there is
   no Piegl–Tiller knot-placement least-squares, no surface fit-to-tolerance,
   no fairing with curvature targets beyond `fair_curve`'s simple smoothing.
9. **No native STEP/IGES B-rep round-trip.** STEP/IGES read and write are
   *entirely* in the OCCT worker (`occ_helpers.load_step`, worker-side
   writers). There is no pure-Python AP203/214 B-rep importer/exporter, so
   fidelity round-trips can't be tested in-process and there is hard OCCT
   coupling for interop.
10. **No SubD↔NURBS bridge and no 2D constraint/curve-boolean.**
    `subd.py` does Catmull–Clark + limit positions but cannot convert a SubD
    cage to a watertight NURBS body (and back). There is no planar region
    boolean (curve loops → faces with holes) — required for sketch-driven
    extrude/pocket without round-tripping to OCCT.

Lower-impact but real: curvature/zebra/deviation analysis exists but is not
validated against analytic surfaces (sphere K=1/r², cylinder one zero
principal curvature); no mesh→NURBS *autosurface* to tolerance (only
per-quad bicubic patching); `make_circle_nurbs` uses **non-rational** points
so it is an *approximate* circle, not the exact rational quadratic Rhino
uses (this silently poisons every downstream "exact radius" oracle).

## 3. Phased roadmap

### P0 — Robustness foundation (make today's breadth trustworthy)

**Rationale.** Breadth is worthless if a sphere∩plane isn't an exact circle,
if `brep.py` validates nothing real, and if there is no closest-point. P0
unifies the evaluator, fixes the exact rational primitives, adds the
closest-point primitive everything depends on, hardens SSI, and **wires the
construction verbs to emit validated `Body` topology**. Nothing in P1+ is
trustworthy until P0 lands.

**Exit criteria.**
- One canonical, correct surface evaluator + analytic derivatives; the buggy
  `nurbs.surface_evaluate` path is removed or delegates.
- `make_circle_nurbs`/conics are exact rational; `sphere∩plane` returns a
  circle whose radius is exact to `1e-9`.
- `closest_point` exists for curve and surface with analytic-verified oracles.
- SSI passes a hardened suite (tangent, closed-loop, small-loop, singular).
- Every construction verb has a `*_to_body` path returning a `Body` that
  passes `validate_body`.
- A pure-Python sew + tolerant boolean produces a `validate_body`-clean
  solid for the box/cylinder/sphere matrix.

### P1 — Comprehensiveness parity

**Rationale.** With a trustworthy core, close the Rhino *feature* gaps:
G1/G2 surface blending/filleting that trims supports and sews, full
fitting/approximation to tolerance with knot placement, surface/curve
offset with exact distance, chamfer + variable fillet, full analysis suite
validated against analytic surfaces, untrim/shrink, Coons/edge surface.

**Exit criteria.** Rhino's surface toolbar verbs each have a Kerf
equivalent that (a) emits a valid `Body` where topological and (b) has an
analytic oracle. Curvature/draft/deviation validated to `1e-6` against
sphere/cylinder/torus.

### P2 — Interop fidelity + SubD/mesh

**Rationale.** Decouple interop from OCCT for testability and fidelity;
add the SubD↔NURBS and mesh→NURBS bridges incumbents have.

**Exit criteria.** Pure-Python STEP AP203/214 B-rep read+write with
Hausdorff ≤ `tol` round-trip on the primitive + filleted-box matrix; 3DM
export; SubD cage → watertight NURBS `Body`; mesh → NURBS to a deviation
tolerance as a single sewn body.

### P3 — Parametric history + advanced (class-A)

**Rationale.** The single highest user-impact gap (#1) plus class-A finish.

**Exit criteria.** In-process feature DAG with regenerate-on-edit driven by
persistent face IDs; G2/G3 blends with curvature-comb continuity proofs;
deviation-driven refinement; zebra/environment continuity analysis.

## 4c. Phase 5 — Class-A depth, generative/implicit, manufacturing prep, assembly (GK-94 … GK-133)

Added 2026-05-21 (second comprehensive audit). Phase 1-4 (GK-01..GK-93) is
complete. Phase 5 is a *grounded* gap analysis against industry kernels
(OCCT, Parasolid, ACIS, OpenSubdiv, CGAL, Rhino/Grasshopper, Blender) of
what Kerf still lacks — **excluding** what already ships: `make2d`
(hidden-line views), `section_contour`, `unroll_srf`, `offset` (curve),
`chamfer`, `fillet_solid`, `leading` (Class-A hotspots), `zebra`,
`curvature_comb`, `hausdorff_deviation`, `blocks` (instancing), `pattern`,
`symmetry`, `wall_thickness`, `draft_analysis`. All pure-Python, additive
to the public façade. **Priority order is listing order**; the top groups
(curve/surface utilities, Class-A analysis) are highest value × smallest
effort.

### Group I — Final scope-closing items (direct modelling, FEM prep, recon)

These six close the *last* gaps found in the exhaustive audit (see §7).
After GK-139 the kernel scope is **closed** — anything not in the §7 matrix
is a deliberate non-goal (§6), not an oversight.

## 5. Parallelization plan

The coupled numerical/topology core is **opus-owned and serialized** because
later tasks consume earlier interfaces (evaluator → derivatives →
closest-point → SSI → brep-build → sew → boolean → history). Everything
file-disjoint and oracle-isolable runs as concurrent sonnet streams.

**Serialized opus spine (one stream, in order):**
GK-01 → GK-02 → GK-06 → GK-07 → GK-09 → GK-13 → GK-17 → GK-18 (+GK-19/21)
→ GK-24 → GK-25/26 → GK-29 → GK-40 → GK-47 → GK-48 → GK-52 → GK-54 →
GK-58 → GK-59 → GK-60 → GK-61 → GK-72.

**First wave (parallel sonnet, no spine dependency):**
GK-03, GK-04, GK-05, GK-22, GK-23 (after GK-13), GK-36 (after GK-02),
GK-55, GK-66. These touch disjoint files (`curve_toolkit.py`,
`nurbs.py`-additive, `surface_analysis.py`, `mesh_repair.py`,
`brep.py`-tests) and have standalone analytic oracles.

**Second wave (parallel sonnet, after their single spine dep lands):**
GK-08, GK-10, GK-11, GK-12, GK-14, GK-15, GK-16(×3 disjoint verb files),
GK-20, GK-27, GK-30, GK-31, GK-33, GK-34, GK-35, GK-37, GK-38, GK-39,
GK-41, GK-42, GK-43, GK-44, GK-46, GK-49, GK-50, GK-51, GK-56, GK-57,
GK-62, GK-63, GK-64, GK-65, GK-67, GK-68, GK-70, GK-71.

**Opus-only, never parallelize with each other** (shared state in
`boolean.py`/`sew.py`/`history/`): GK-18/19/21, GK-45, GK-52/53, GK-58/59/
60/61, GK-69, GK-72.

Practical pool: ~1 opus on the spine continuously; 4–5 sonnet on the wave
buckets. Wave 2 unblocks roughly when GK-13 (brep-build) lands — that is
the single highest-leverage gate; prioritise the spine to GK-13/17/18.

---

## 6. Non-goals / OCCT boundary

**Stay delegated to the OCCT worker (do not reimplement):**

- Industrial STEP/IGES *robustness* on adversarial third-party files (OCCT's
  STEP healing is decades-deep). Kerf owns a *pure-Python* path (GK-47/48)
  for testability, fidelity round-trips, and decoupling — **not** to replace
  OCCT as the import workhorse for messy customer data. The worker remains
  the fallback.
- Heavy meshing/tessellation for display/STL (`occ_helpers.mesh_shape`,
  `BRepMesh`). Pure-Python tessellation only where an analytic oracle needs
  it.
- Parasolid/ACIS kernels and their file formats — not a goal at any phase.
  We do not buy or clone a commercial kernel.
- Any GPU/native-extension geometry. Kerf geom stays NumPy/pure-Python so it
  runs in-process, is hermetically testable, and ships in the single binary.

**Own in pure-Python (the moat — what incumbents license-gate):**

- The **parametric/history layer** (P3). This is the highest user-impact gap
  and is *not* something OCCT gives you; it is product, not kernel. Owning
  the feature DAG + persistent naming is non-negotiable.
- The **tolerant-modelling layer**: per-entity tolerance, propagation,
  sewing, gap-closing on our own `Body`. We must not be unable to make a
  valid solid when OCCT is absent.
- The **algorithm layer incumbents gate behind license**: closest-point,
  SSI, fitting/approximation to tolerance, G1/G2/G3 blending with verified
  continuity, curvature/zebra/deviation analysis. These are the depth gap;
  they are pure math and belong to Kerf.
- The **topology keystone** (`brep.py`) and everything that emits/validates
  it — already done and frozen; the roadmap binds the rest to it.

Rationale: delegate the things that are *integration breadth and 30-year
hardening* (messy import robustness, display meshing); own the things that
are *math depth and product* (history, tolerant modelling, the gated
algorithms). The line is "would a competitor's license forbid us, or is it
just plumbing?" — we own the former, delegate the latter.

## 7. Kernel completeness matrix — DEFINITIVE SCOPE (2026-05-21)

This is the **once-and-for-all** map of the geometry-kernel feature space,
built from an exhaustive audit against OCCT, Parasolid, ACIS, OpenSubdiv,
CGAL, libIGL, Rhino/OpenNURBS and Blender. Every capability a production
parametric + freeform + SubD + mesh kernel can have is listed below and
marked **✅ shipped**, **🟡 Phase 5 (GK-94..GK-139, planned)**, or

this matrix, it does not belong in this kernel** — the search for "more
features" ends here. New work attaches to an existing row or it is a product
layer (history/UI/CAM/FEM packages), not the geometry kernel.

### Z. Deliberate non-goals (⛔ — never in this kernel; see §6)
| Capability | Why not |
|---|---|
| Cloning OCCT/Parasolid/ACIS | Buy/wrap, don't reinvent |
| Messy real-world STEP/IGES import hardening | 30-yr problem → delegate to OCCT |
| Display-scale tessellation / BRepMesh | Delegate; pure-Py only where an oracle needs it |
| GPU / native-extension geometry | Stays NumPy/pure-Py: in-process, hermetic, single-binary |
| Parametric history / feature DAG | Product layer (not kernel) — owned separately |
| CAM toolpathing | `kerf-cam` package |
| FEA solving | `kerf-fem` package (kernel only feeds it meshes via GK-136) |
| Rendering / UV-unwrap / texturing | Frontend / viewer concern |
| Kinematics / motion / CFD simulation | Out of geometry-kernel scope entirely |

**Conclusion:** Phases 1-4 (GK-01..GK-93) shipped. Phase 5 (GK-94..GK-139,
46 items) covers every remaining ✅-able row. When Phase 5 lands, the
geometry kernel is **feature-complete against the industry** — the only
things left are the ⛔ rows, which are intentional product/package
boundaries, not gaps. No further "what are we missing" audits are needed.

STATUS: Phases 1-4 COMPLETE (GK-01..GK-93). Phase 5 in progress (GK-94..GK-139). Scope CLOSED per §7 matrix.
