# Kerf + OpenPLC

OpenPLC is not a competitor to Kerf. It is a complementary open-source PLC runtime and IDE that Kerf integrates with to bridge the gap between hardware design (PCB, enclosure) and the IEC 61131-3 control logic that runs on that hardware. This page explains what OpenPLC does, what Kerf adds on top, and why they are stronger together.

## What OpenPLC is

OpenPLC is an open-source IEC 61131-3 compliant PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) runtime and editor developed by Thiago Rodrigues Alves. It implements all five IEC 61131-3 programming languages:

- **LD** — Ladder Diagram
- **ST** — Structured Text
- **FBD** — Function Block Diagram
- **SFC** — Sequential Function Chart
- **IL** — Instruction List (deprecated but supported)

OpenPLC Runtime runs on Linux (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, industrial SBCs), Windows, and Arduino-compatible hardware. The OpenPLC Editor (based on Beremiz) is a cross-platform IDE for writing and compiling IEC 61131-3 programs. The runtime compiles to C++ and runs without a commercial PLC licence. It is used in industrial automation education, open hardware SCADA systems, and research.

## Where they converge

Both OpenPLC and Kerf target hardware engineers who are building control systems — whether for industrial automation, building management, or custom machinery. Both are open-source (OpenPLC: Apache 2.0; Kerf: MIT). Both acknowledge that the software and the hardware are not separate concerns: OpenPLC runs on real hardware (Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino); Kerf designs that hardware (PCB schematic, layout, enclosure, pre-compliance simulation).

## What Kerf adds

Kerf integrates OpenPLC as a companion for hardware projects that include a programmable control element:

- **PCB design for the hardware that runs OpenPLC.** Design the I/O board, the relay driver, the sensor frontend, or the custom SBC carrier in Kerf's PCB workspace. Pre-compliance simulate the power supply, the I/O bus isolation, and the EMC protection circuits before ordering. The PCB and the PLC program that runs on it live in the same Kerf project.
- **Chat-native PLC logic generation.** Describe the control logic — "on rising edge of DI1, start FAN_MOTOR timer for 30s; stop if DI2 is active" — and the LLM generates OpenPLC Structured Text code backed by IEC 61131-3 doc-search.
- **Enclosure design.** Model the DIN-rail enclosure or panel in Kerf's mechanical workspace. Sheet metal flat patterns, enclosure cutouts for I/O connectors, and DIN rail mounting geometry are all in the same project.
- **Unified project and version control.** PLC program, PCB design, BOM, and enclosure model are in one Kerf project with cloud-git versioning — a complete machine build history.

## Where OpenPLC is stronger on its own

- **Runtime depth.** An experienced PLC programmer using OpenPLC directly has access to the full runtime configuration — scan cycle tuning, modbus mapping, I/O pin assignment, hardware driver configuration — without LLM abstraction.
- **Hardware abstraction layer.** OpenPLC's HAL covers Raspberry Pi GPIO, Arduino analogWrite/digitalRead, and Modbus TCP/RTU slave — a broad set of hardware targets that Kerf's integration wraps at a higher level.
- **Community and educational resources.** OpenPLC has a dedicated user community, instructional videos, and industrial automation curriculum built around it. Kerf's PLC integration is a bridge, not a replacement for that learning.
- **CODESYS compatibility.** OpenPLC's code is importable/exportable in ways compatible with some CODESYS workflows. Kerf does not target full CODESYS interop.

## Feature matrix

| Feature | Kerf | OpenPLC (standalone) |
|---|---|---|
| License | MIT (Kerf) + Apache 2.0 (OpenPLC) | Apache 2.0 |
| IEC 61131-3 languages | LD + ST (chat-native generation + LadderEditor) | LD, ST, FBD, SFC, IL |
| PLCopen XML import/export (IEC TR 61131-10) | ✅ `import_plcopen_xml` + `export_plcopen_xml` LLM tools; LadderEditor Import/Export buttons | ✅ Beremiz-based editor reads/writes PLCopen XML natively |
| Runtime targets | Via OpenPLC: RPi, Arduino, Linux | RPi, BeagleBone, Arduino, Linux, Windows |
| Chat-native logic generation | Yes | No |
| PCB design for target hardware | In-box (full Kerf PCB workflow) | Not included |
| Enclosure / mechanical | In-box (Kerf mechanical) | Not included |
| Pre-compliance simulation | In-box (SI/EMC/PDN/thermal) | Not included |
| Hardware I/O pin mapping | Via OpenPLC config | OpenPLC Editor + HAL |
| Modbus TCP/RTU | Via OpenPLC runtime | Yes (built-in) |
| OTA delivery (cloud endpoint) | ✅ POST /firmware/ota/release — Ed25519-signed; ESP32/STM32/SAMD backends | ❌ Not included (manual flash only) |
| BOM management | In-box (Kerf BOM + distributors) | Not included |
| Project version control | Cloud git (Kerf) | External (git manually) |
| Python scripting | kerf-sdk on PyPI | None (runtime is C++) |
| Open source | Yes (MIT + Apache) | Yes (Apache 2.0) |

## Both produce IEC 61131-3 Structured Text

OpenPLC and Kerf's OpenPLC integration both produce IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) programs that compile to the OpenPLC runtime. ST programs generated by Kerf's chat interface are standard IEC 61131-3 text — open the `.st` file in the OpenPLC Editor directly, inspect it, modify it, and compile it independently of Kerf. No proprietary format or lock-in.
