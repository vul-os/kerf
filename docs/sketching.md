# Sketching

Create 2D profiles with geometric and dimensional constraints, then extrude or revolve them into 3D solid bodies.

## The .sketch JSON format

A `.sketch` file is a self-contained JSON document that describes all geometry, constraints, and solver metadata:

```json
{
  "schema": "kerf.sketch.v1",
  "coordinateSystem": { "origin": [0, 0, 0], "axis": "Z" },
  "geometry": [
    { "id": "L1", "type": "line", "points": [["P0", "P1"]] },
    { "id": "C1", "type": "circle", "center": "P2", "radius": 10 }
  ],
  "points": [
    { "id": "P0", "x": 0, "y": 0 },
    { "id": "P1", "x": 50, "y": 0 },
    { "id": "P2", "x": 25, "y": 30 }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    { "type": "distance", "entityA": "L1", "value": 50 },
    { "type": "coincident", "entityA": "P0", "entityB": "P2" }
  ],
  "solver": { "engine": "planegcs", "status": "under-constrained" }
}
```

## Coordinate system

Sketches live on a work plane. By default the XY plane is used (`axis: "Z"`), meaning the sketch normal points in +Z. The `origin` field sets the sketch's base point in model space. When a sketch is placed on a face (3D backdrop), the coordinate system aligns to that face's plane.

Units are millimeters. All geometry exists in model space, not normalized coordinates.

## Primitives

### Point

```json
{ "id": "P0", "x": 0, "y": 0 }
```

Standalone reference points used as construction geometry or constraint anchors.

### Line

```json
{ "id": "L1", "type": "line", "points": [["P0", "P1"]] }
```

Two-point segments. Chain lines by sharing an endpoint point. The solver treats each segment independently; use `coincident` constraints to connect them.

### Arc

```json
{ "id": "A1", "type": "arc", "start": "P0", "end": "P1", "center": "PC", "radius": 15 }
```

Three-point arc or center-plus-endpoints. The `start` and `end` fields reference point IDs. The arc direction (CW/CCW) is inferred from constraint context.

### Circle

```json
{ "id": "C1", "type": "circle", "center": "P0", "radius": 10 }
```

Center point + radius. Dimensional constraints (`radius`, `diameter`) can be applied.

### Ellipse

```json
{ "id": "E1", "type": "ellipse", "center": "P0", "radiusX": 20, "radiusY": 10 }
```

Full ellipse defined by center point and semi-axes.

### B-spline

```json
{ "id": "B1", "type": "bspline", "controlPoints": ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3"], "degree": 3 }
```

Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS). Control points are point IDs. The `degree` defaults to 3 (cubic). B-splines can represent complex curves that are difficult to construct from primitive arcs.

### Polyline

```json
{ "id": "PL1", "type": "polyline", "points": ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3"] }
```

A run of connected line segments sharing endpoints. Equivalent to chained lines but stored as a single entity.

## Constraints

Constraints are classified as **geometric** (quality) or **dimensional** (size). The `planegcs` solver (a FreeCAD PlaneGCS port) finds point coordinate assignments that satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

### Geometric constraints

| Constraint      | Selection                             | Meaning                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| coincident      | point + point, or point + curve       | Snap one point onto another point or curve   |
| parallel        | line + line                           | Lines share the same direction              |
| parallel_lines  | line + line                           | Same direction (planegcs primitive)         |
| perpendicular   | line + line                           | 90° angle between lines                    |
| tangent         | line + circle/arc, or circle + circle | External tangency at point of contact       |
| equal length    | line + line, or arc + arc             | Identical size                              |
| equal radius    | circle + circle, or arc + arc         | Identical radius                            |
| equal_angle     | line + line                           | Identical angle between pairs               |
| symmetric       | point + point, line + line            | Mirror symmetry about a centerline          |
| block           | point                                 | Lock point at current (x, y)                |
| fix             | any entity                            | Lock entity at its current position         |
| horizontal      | line                                  | Force line to be horizontal                 |
| vertical        | line                                  | Force line to be vertical                   |

```json
{ "type": "parallel", "entityA": "L1", "entityB": "L2" }
```

### Dimensional constraints

| Constraint         | Selection                      | Parameter            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| distance           | point + point, or line + line  | Length in mm         |
| horizontal_distance| point + point                  | X projection in mm   |
| vertical_distance  | point + point                  | Y projection in mm   |
| angle              | line + line                    | Angle in degrees     |
| radius             | circle, arc                    | Radius in mm         |
| diameter           | circle                         | Diameter in mm       |

```json
{ "type": "distance", "entityA": "L1", "value": 25.5 }
```

## Pattern operations

### Mirror

Mirror geometry about a centerline (axis entity):

```json
{ "type": "mirror", "entities": ["L1", "C1"], "axis": "L_mirror" }
```

### Linear pattern

Duplicate entities along a direction vector:

```json
{ "type": "pattern_linear", "entities": ["L1"], "direction": [1, 0, 0], "count": 5, "spacing": 10 }
```

### Polar pattern

Duplicate entities around a center point:

```json
{ "type": "pattern_polar", "entities": ["L1"], "center": "PC", "count": 6, "angle": 360 }
```

## Trim, extend, offset

These operations modify existing curves in-place:

- **trim** — Cut a curve at its intersection with another curve
- **extend** — Lengthen a line or arc to meet another curve or a distance
- **offset** — Create a curve parallel to the source at a given distance

```json
{ "type": "trim", "target": "L1", "tool": "A1" }
```

```json
{ "type": "extend", "entity": "L1", "length": 20 }
```

```json
{ "type": "offset", "source": "C1", "distance": 5, "side": "outside" }
```

## External geometry projection

Reference edges from 3D geometry into the sketch. Projected entities are treated as construction geometry (not solvable):

```json
{
  "type": "external_projection",
  "source": { "type": "edge_ref", "file_id": "part-uuid", "object_id": "body-uuid", "edge_index": 0 },
  "projected": { "type": "line", "points": [["P_proj_start", "P_proj_end"]] }
}
```

When the source 3D geometry changes, the projection updates automatically.

## Multi-loop holes

A single sketch can contain multiple closed loops. When extruded via the `.feature` pipeline, nested loops automatically become pockets (boolean subtract). The `sketchGeom2.js` converter sorts loops by area — largest is the outer boundary; smaller loops contained within are treated as holes (CW orientation subtracted from the outer CCW region).

```json
{
  "geometry": [
    { "id": "outer", "type": "polyline", "points": ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3"], "closed": true },
    { "id": "hole1", "type": "circle", "center": "PH1", "radius": 5 },
    { "id": "hole2", "type": "circle", "center": "PH2", "radius": 3 }
  ]
}
```

## 3D backdrop

When editing a sketch on a feature face, the parent solid renders behind the sketch plane for context. Set `visible_3d` in the sketch metadata to include entity IDs to render, or enable `SketchBackdrop3D` in the UI to show the full solid as a translucent backdrop.

## Carbon copy

Pull geometry from another sketch as driven reference entities using `sketch_carbon_copy`. Copied entities carry `is_reference: true` and `construction: true` — they render distinctly and are excluded from extrusion.

```json
{
  "id": "profile_rect_L1",
  "type": "line",
  "p1": "profile_rect_origin",
  "p2": "profile_rect_p1",
  "is_reference": true,
  "construction": true,
  "cc_source": "profile_rect_sketch",
  "source_id": "L1"
}
```

The top-level `cc_sources` array tracks source sketch IDs. Use `sketch_validate` to check for unresolved references.

**LLM tool:** `sketch_carbon_copy({ source_file_path, target_file_path, entity_ids?, translation?, rotation_deg? })`

## Edge projection

Project edges from existing 3D features into the sketch. The projection preserves curve type — arcs project as arcs, circles as circles, B-splines as B-splines.

```json
{
  "type": "external_projection",
  "source": { "type": "edge_ref", "file_id": "part-uuid", "object_id": "body-uuid", "edge_index": 0 },
  "projected": { "type": "arc", "start": "P_proj_s", "end": "P_proj_e", "center": "P_proj_c", "radius": 15 }
}
```

Projected entities update automatically when the source geometry changes.

## Solver behavior

The `planegcs` solver reports one of three states:

| Status             | DOF count | Meaning                                   |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `fully-constrained` | 0         | All degrees of freedom resolved           |
| `under-constrained`| > 0       | Geometry can still move; add constraints  |
| `over-constrained` | n/a       | Conflicting constraints; solver ignores one |

Entity colors in the viewport reflect solver state:
- **Black** — fully constrained, will not drag
- **Blue** — under-constrained, free to drag
- **Red** — over-constrained or contradictory

Drag a blue point to explore the design space interactively; the solver finds the nearest valid configuration each frame.

## LLM tools

Chat can create and modify sketches using these tools:

| Tool               | Purpose                                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `create_sketch`    | Seed a new empty sketch file                   |
| `sketch_add_point` | Add a point entity                             |
| `sketch_add_line`  | Add a line between two point IDs               |
| `sketch_add_arc`   | Add an arc (start/end/center or 3-point)       |
| `sketch_add_circle`| Add a circle with center and radius            |
| `sketch_add_constraint` | Apply a geometric or dimensional constraint |
| `sketch_trim`      | Trim a curve at an intersection                |
| `sketch_extend`    | Extend a curve to meet another or a distance   |
| `sketch_offset`    | Offset a curve by a distance                   |
| `sketch_mirror`    | Mirror entities about an axis                  |
| `sketch_pattern_linear` | Create a linear pattern                   |
| `sketch_pattern_polar`  | Create a polar pattern                    |
| `sketch_add_bspline`   | Add a B-spline                          |
| `sketch_add_ellipse`    | Add an ellipse                        |
| `sketch_carbon_copy` | Copy geometry from another sketch as reference |
| `sketch_validate`  | Validate sketch for errors before extrusion     |

## Validation

Run `sketch_validate({ file_path })` before using a sketch in a feature operation. Returns `{ errors, warnings }` with `{ kind, severity, message, entity_id? }`.

| Kind                      | Severity | Trigger                                         |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `open_contour`            | error    | Edge loop has an endpoint connected to only one edge |
| `self_intersection`       | error    | Non-adjacent edges cross                        |
| `redundant_constraint`    | error    | DOF < 0 (over-constrained)                    |
| `dangling_endpoint`       | warning  | Endpoint has no coincident/fixed constraint    |
| `unresolved_external_ref`  | error    | Reference source sketch is missing or deleted  |

A sketch with zero errors is safe to extrude.

## Exporting to JSCAD

Import a compiled sketch into a `.jscad` file:

```js
import profile from '/sketches/flange.sketch'
import { extrusions } from '@jscad/modeling'

export default function () {
  const flange = extrusions.extrudeLinear({ height: 10 }, profile())
  return [{ id: 'flange', geom: flange }]
}
```

The imported function returns a fresh Geom2 each call, compatible with `extrudeLinear`, `extrudeRotate`, sweep, and boolean operations.
