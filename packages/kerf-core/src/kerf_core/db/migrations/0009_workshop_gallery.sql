-- project_workshop_images: Thingiverse-style multi-image gallery
-- attached to a project for Workshop publishing. Complements the
-- existing single thumbnail_storage_key (auto-captured from the editor);
-- gallery images are uploader-curated cover art.
--
-- Caps enforced at upload time in kerf-api:
--   * 10 images per project
--   * 5 MB per image
--   * JPEG / PNG / WebP only

-- Add is_primary flag to project_workshop_images.
-- At most one image per project may be primary (enforced via partial
-- unique index). When is_primary = true the image is used as the
-- project tile + Workshop browse-grid thumbnail instead of the
-- auto-captured thumbnail_storage_key; the auto-capture becomes a
-- fallback shown only when no gallery image is pinned.

--
-- Add `readme` markdown field to the projects table so Workshop-published
-- projects carry a rich, AI-generated README (Markdown) as their primary
-- content surface.
--
-- Design notes:
--   * The field is nullable; existing rows default to NULL (no README).
--   * The README is stored as raw Markdown text.  Sanitisation is the
--     responsibility of the rendering layer (frontend: rehype-sanitize /
--     react-markdown; backend: bleach if needed before returning to API).
--   * `readme_generated_at` tracks when the field was last written so the
--     frontend can show a "generated N minutes ago" label and the backend
--     can skip re-generation when the project has not changed.
--   * `cover_storage_key` is a separate field for the auto-rendered hero
--     image (a distinct concern from the auto-captured thumbnail_storage_key
--     which is the live editor snapshot).  When present, it overrides the
--     thumbnail in the Workshop browse grid / listing hero.
--
-- Round-trip: kerf-api reads and writes both fields in the workshop publish
-- handler and the /workshop/:slug GET endpoint.
