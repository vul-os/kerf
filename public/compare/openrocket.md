# Kerf + OpenRocket

OpenRocket is not a competitor to Kerf. It is a complementary open-source model rocket simulation tool that Kerf integrates with for rocketry projects — where the rocket motor selection, trajectory, and stability analysis from OpenRocket connect to the airframe geometry, avionics PCB, and recovery electronics designed in Kerf.

## What OpenRocket is

OpenRocket is a free, open-source model rocket flight simulator developed by Sampo Niskanen as a Master's thesis at Helsinki University of Technology and now maintained by the OpenRocket community. It provides:

- **6-DOF flight simulation** of model and high-power rockets
- **Stability analysis** (Barrowman method for static margin, CP, CG)
- **Motor database** integration (Thrustcurve, RASP .eng files)
- **Aerobraking and recovery event simulation** (parachute deployment, drift)
- **Fin flutter analysis**
- **Optimisation** of nose cone shape, fin geometry, and mass distribution
- **Export** of simulation data (CSV, KML for Google Earth trajectory)

OpenRocket runs on any platform (Java). It is widely used by NAR/TRA high-power rocketry enthusiasts, university rocketry teams, and educational programs. It is Apache 2.0 licensed.

## Where they converge

Both OpenRocket and Kerf are open-source and free. Both are used by university rocketry teams and high-power rocketry clubs. Both acknowledge that a rocket is a multi-domain system: the aerodynamics and flight dynamics are inseparable from the structure, the avionics, and the recovery system. OpenRocket handles the simulation; Kerf handles the physical design.

## What Kerf adds

Kerf integrates OpenRocket as a simulation backend for rocketry projects and adds the hardware design layer:

- **Airframe geometry from the Kerf model.** Design the nose cone, body tube, fin geometry, and centering rings in Kerf's mechanical workspace with exact B-rep precision (wall thickness, material density, mass estimation). Export geometry parameters to OpenRocket for stability simulation.
- **Avionics PCB design.** Design the flight computer PCB (altimeter, GPS logger, deployment system, radio telemetry) in Kerf's PCB workspace. Pre-compliance simulate the RF antenna, power supply, and ignition circuit within the same project. The PCB and the rocket it flies in live in one Kerf project.
- **Recovery electronics.** Design the e-match driver circuits, dual-deploy pyro channel, and battery protection in Kerf's schematic and PCB workspace with the same pre-compliance simulation tools used for any electronics project.
- **Chat-native flight sim.** Describe a simulation scenario — "simulate this motor selection at 30°C, 1500m altitude, with a 2-second apogee delay" — and the LLM invokes OpenRocket with the correct parameters.
- **Unified project.** Motor selection, trajectory data, airframe CAD, avionics PCB, BOM, and recovery system design are all in one Kerf project with cloud-git versioning.

## Where OpenRocket is stronger on its own

- **Flight dynamics depth.** An experienced rocketeer using OpenRocket directly can tune every simulation parameter — drag coefficients, fin flutter margins, motor clustering, rail exit velocity — with finer control than Kerf's chat abstraction.
- **Motor database.** OpenRocket integrates with Thrustcurve's complete motor database covering every certified NAR/TRA motor. Kerf wraps this database through OpenRocket but does not replicate it independently.
- **Community and NAR/TRA workflows.** OpenRocket is the community-standard simulation tool for high-power rocketry certification and club launches. Kerf is a hardware design platform that integrates OpenRocket, not a replacement for it.
- **Component library.** OpenRocket has a built-in library of common body tubes, nose cones, and fins (Estes, LOC, etc.) that Kerf does not replicate.

## Feature matrix

| Feature | Kerf | OpenRocket (standalone) |
|---|---|---|
| License | MIT (Kerf) + Apache 2.0 (OpenRocket) | Apache 2.0 |
| 6-DOF flight simulation | Yes (via OpenRocket) | Yes |
| Stability analysis (Barrowman) | Yes (via OpenRocket) | Yes |
| Motor database (Thrustcurve) | Yes (via OpenRocket) | Yes |
| Fin flutter analysis | Yes (via OpenRocket) | Yes |
| Trajectory export (KML/CSV) | Yes | Yes |
| Airframe 3D CAD | In-box (Kerf mechanical) | Component diagram (no B-rep) |
| Avionics PCB design | In-box (Kerf PCB + pre-compliance) | Not included |
| Recovery electronics | In-box (Kerf schematic + PCB) | Not included |
| BOM management | In-box (Kerf BOM) | Not included |
| Chat-native simulation | Yes | No |
| Project version control | Cloud git (Kerf) | External (git manually) |
| Python scripting | kerf-sdk on PyPI | None (GUI tool) |
| Open source | Yes (MIT + Apache) | Yes (Apache 2.0) |

## Both produce simulation data (CSV / KML)

OpenRocket and Kerf's OpenRocket integration both produce trajectory simulation data in CSV and KML format. A flight simulation run via Kerf's chat interface produces the same OpenRocket output files as a direct OpenRocket run — the data is standard and can be opened in OpenRocket directly for deeper analysis, or plotted in Python.
