## 1. Why split it

T-104 as written is a single Tier-A P1 epic that bundles three
independently-shippable workstreams plus one structurally-impossible
ask:

1. **Trim-by-curve / imprint** — pure-Python face split by an SSI /
   projected curve (roadmap `GK-40`, plus a worker-side fallback).
2. **Class-A leading** — the surface-quality *workflow* (curvature
   combs + zebra + G-continuity acceptance gate; roadmap
   `GK-38`/`GK-64`).
3. **Algorithmic G3** — third-derivative-continuous blends. **This is
   the trap.** Stock OCCT *cannot* enforce G3: `GeomAbs_G3` does not
   exist in the `GeomAbs_Shape` enum (confirmed in
   `surfacing.py:1096-1100` and `nurbs-phase-4-full.md:5-6,41-42`).
   What *is* achievable is (a) a **pure-Python NURBS** G3 blend in
   `geom/blend_srf.py` (roadmap `GK-62`, no OCCT involved — pure math,
   so the impossibility does not apply to the Kerf pure-Python layer)
   and (b) the **already-shipped visualization** path (eyeball G3 via
   curvature combs). We must NOT write a sub-task that demands stock
   OCCT enforce G3 — that is the structurally-impossible item to flag.

Each of these is a different file-set, a different oracle, and a
different risk profile. Bundled, no single Sonnet agent can land it in
one isolated-worktree run. Split, every piece is bounded, analytically
oracled, and sequenced foundations-first.

## 2. Current kernel state (verified at 384f401)

| Area | What exists today | Gap T-104 must close |
|---|---|---|
| **Pure-Py G1/G2 blend** | `surface_fillet.py:surface_blend_g1_g2` builds a cubic NURBS blend strip; `curvature_comb_continuity_residual` is the analytic G1/G2 residual oracle (cross-tangent ‖t_b×t_s‖ for G1, principal-curvature delta for G2). Re-exported via `blend_srf.py`. | No **G3** (curvature-rate / third-derivative) residual or enforcement. `blend_srf.g2_blend_point` is a fake additive nudge — not curvature-continuous. The *verified* path is `surface_blend_g1_g2`. |
| **Trim-by-curve** | `geom/trim_curve.py:trim_face` is pure-Python **UV-domain validation only** — it projects a polyline, checks divisibility, returns a `TrimCurve`; it does **not** perform a B-rep split (docstring lines 446-449). The actual split is `surfacing.py:feature_trim_by_curve` → OCCT worker `opTrimByCurve` (`BRepFeat_SplitShape` / `BRepProj_Projection`). C2-T12 Section+prism fallback is **unbuilt**. | No pure-Python `Face`→split-`Face` that emits a `validate_body`-clean trimmed face (this is roadmap `GK-40`, still `[ ]`). |
| **Face imprint** | `geom/boolean.py` GK-19 imprints an SSI curve into a `Face` via `mef`/`kemr` — but **only for the analytic primitive matrix** (axis-aligned box / world-axis cylinder / sphere; docstring lines 9-44). General NURBS face imprint raises `unsupported-input`. | Generalise imprint to a **projected/SSI curve on an arbitrary NURBS `Face`** (the GK-40 building block). |
| **Curvature combs** | `surfacing.py:feature_surface_curvature_combs` — worker samples `GeomLProp_SLProps`, `CurvatureCombOverlay.jsx` renders. Shipped. Explicitly **visualization-only**; G3 is "eyeball it". | No *numeric exported comb-of-combs* (curvature-rate) oracle in pure-Python; no class-A acceptance gate that consumes it. |
| **Zebra / reflection lines** | `surface_analysis.py:zebra_stripe` returns a scalar intensity at one (u,v). No analyser that detects stripe-tangent discontinuity across a join; no overlay. (roadmap `GK-38` still `[ ]`.) | A zebra/reflection-line *continuity analyser* with a G1/G2-break oracle. |
| **Edge continuity report** | `surface_analysis.py:edge_continuity_report` reports **G0/G1/G2 only** (position / normal-angle / mean-curvature delta). | Extend with a **G3 (curvature-rate) residual** column for the pure-Python class-A gate; add the analytic third-derivative oracle. (roadmap `GK-62`/`GK-64`.) |
| **Class-A harness** | None. roadmap `GK-64` (curvature combs + zebra + G-continuity report on a reference A-surface fixture) is unbuilt. | The acceptance harness + leading workflow that flags hot-spots. |

**Bottom line.** The verified pure-Python continuity machinery tops out
at **G2** (`surface_blend_g1_g2` + `curvature_comb_continuity_residual`).
Trim-by-curve has a worker path but **no pure-Python B-rep split**.
There is **no** zebra analyser, **no** class-A gate, and G3 is
visualization-only on the OCCT side.

## 3. The structural-impossibility call-outs (read this before writing scopes)

These are baked into the sub-task scopes/DoDs so no agent burns a run
chasing them:

1. **Algorithmic G3 in stock OCCT is impossible.** `GeomAbs_G3` is
   absent from the `GeomAbs_Shape` enum. No OCCT API (`BRepFilletAPI`,
   `GeomFill`, `ShapeUpgrade`, `GeomConvert`) can *enforce* or *report*
   G3. **Any sub-task touching OCCT for G3 must be visualization /
   approximation only** (eyeball via combs — already shipped). This is
   flagged on **T-104f** and **T-104g**.

2. **G3 *is* achievable in the pure-Python NURBS layer.** Third-
   derivative continuity of two NURBS surfaces meeting at a seam is
   closed-form math (homogeneous quotient rule, `nurbs.py`'s analytic
   derivatives from GK-02). The Kerf pure-Python kernel is *not* OCCT,
   so the OCCT enum limitation does not bind it. T-104b/T-104c deliver
   the **pure-Python** algorithmic G3 (roadmap `GK-62`). DoD oracle is
   analytic (third-derivative residual `< 1e-5` across a known join,
   comb-of-combs continuous), exactly matching `GK-62`.

3. **Pure-Python trimmed-solid round-trip is bounded but real.** GK-40
   (trim face by SSI curve) is a known long-tail item but it is *pure
   math* on top of the already-landed SSI (GK-09) + closest-point
   (GK-07) + brep_build (GK-13) + `boolean.py` imprint (GK-19). It is
   bounded for one agent if scoped to **plane / cylinder / sphere
   carrier surfaces** (the same analytic matrix `boolean.py` already
   supports) — *not* arbitrary NURBS×NURBS, which stays delegated to
   the OCCT worker. T-104d is scoped to that matrix; the general
   NURBS×NURBS trim explicitly stays on the OCCT worker path
   (`feature_trim_by_curve`) and is **out of T-104's pure-Python
   scope** — documented, not attempted.

4. **The OCCT worker trim fallback (C2-T12 Section+prism) is JS/WASM
   worker code**, not kernel. It is *out of scope* for T-104's
   pure-Python sub-tasks (and would collide with worker-owning agents);
   T-104e covers only the **pure-Python validation + side-selection
   contract** that the worker consumes, plus wiring the pure-Python
   `GK-40` result as the in-process answer when the carrier is in the
   analytic matrix (OCCT worker stays the fallback for everything else).

                                                  T-104g  (class-A acceptance

                                                           G0..G3 gate)
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                                  T-104h  (class-A *leading*
                                                           workflow — hot-spot
                                                           flagging surface)

Foundations first:  T-104a → T-104b → T-104c   (the algorithmic-G3 spine, opus-grade math but each bounded)
Parallelisable:      T-104d (after GK-40 deps already landed) ‖ T-104f (after T-104a)
Gate + workflow:     T-104g depends on T-104a + T-104f ;  T-104h depends on T-104g
Worker contract:     T-104e depends on T-104c + T-104d
```

`Depends-on` uses **T-104** ids only where the dependency is *within
this epic*; where a sub-task builds on already-landed roadmap items
(GK-02 analytic derivatives, GK-07 closest-point, GK-09 SSI, GK-13
brep_build, GK-19 imprint, GK-24/25 G1/G2 blend) that is noted in the
Scope, not as a blocking `Depends-on` (those are shipped at 384f401).

## 5. Money / reach ranking (why this order)

T-104 is Tier-A P1 because it serves **two high-value personas**
(automotive Class-A surfacing, jewelry Class-A surfacing) and is the
kernel-depth opus-spine moat the §6 geometry-kernel thesis demands.
Within the split:

1. **T-104a/b/c (algorithmic G3 spine)** rank highest: this is the
   *only genuinely-new kernel capability* in the epic and the headline
   "G3" deliverable. Pure-Python, so it is real (not the OCCT
   eyeball-only path). Foundations — everything class-A leans on the
   residual oracle.
2. **T-104d/e (pure-Python trim-by-curve)** next: closes the GK-40
   long-tail and removes a hard OCCT coupling for the bounded analytic
   matrix; directly serves the jewelry "cut a stone-setting window"
   and automotive panel-trim workflows.
3. **T-104f/g/h (zebra + class-A gate + leading)** close the
   *workflow* gap — the deliverable users actually see ("flag the
   hot-spots on my fender"). Lower kernel-depth but high persona reach;
   sequenced last because the gate consumes the G3 residual oracle from
   T-104a.

---

## 6. Out of scope for T-104 (documented, not attempted)

- General **NURBS×NURBS** trim-by-curve and boolean imprint — stays on
  the OCCT worker (`feature_trim_by_curve` / `run_feature_boolean`).
  T-104's pure-Python trim is bounded to the plane/cyl/sphere carrier
  matrix `boolean.py` already supports.
- The **C2-T12 Section+prism JS/WASM worker fallback** — worker code,
  owned elsewhere, would collide with concurrent agents.
- **OCCT algorithmic G3** — structurally impossible; the shipped
  visualization path is the OCCT answer and is not re-opened.
- `src/routes/compare`, `docs/*.md` capability pages, migrations,
  kerf-cli — owned by other concurrent agents this session.
- Parasolid/ACIS, GPU/native geometry — non-goals at every phase
  (geometry-kernel-roadmap §6).

## 7. Mapping to the geometry-kernel roadmap

| T-104 sub-task | roadmap GK item(s) | roadmap status at 384f401 |
|---|---|---|
| T-104a | GK-62 (oracle half), GK-65 (comb numeric) | `[ ]` |
| T-104b | GK-62 (blend half) | `[ ]` |
| T-104c | GK-62 + GK-26-style trim/sew pattern | `[ ]` |
| T-104d | **GK-40** (trim face by SSI curve) | `[ ]` (opus) |
| T-104e | GK-40 wiring + GK-71 façade note | `[ ]` |
| T-104f | **GK-38** (zebra / reflection-line) | `[ ]` |
| T-104g | **GK-64** (class-A acceptance harness) | `[ ]` |
| T-104h | GK-64 follow-on (leading workflow) | new (product layer) |

These remain the single source of truth in
`geometry-kernel-roadmap.md`; T-104a..h are the *task-board* face of
the same work, sized for the ship-gate agent loop. Closing a T-104
sub-task should also tick its GK checkbox.
