"""Regression: migration runner must skip comments-only "tombstone" files.

T-307 folded every alter/drop shim back into the originating CREATE TABLE,
which left three migrations (0003_revisions_prefs.sql,
0007_step_tess_revision_finalize.sql, 0009_workshop_gallery.sql) as pure
comments — no SQL statements at all. A fourth, 0012_cloud_git.sql, joined
them 2026-07-18 when its three tables (cloud_git_repos/branches/commits)
were dropped as dead DDL — hosted git is retired as a product and nothing
in-tree read or wrote them any more.

asyncpg's simple-query response parser crashes with
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` when the
server returns an EmptyQueryResponse (no command tag) — exactly what
happens for a comments-only file. The Fly `release_command` deploy
aborted because of this on 2026-05-19.

The runner now strips line comments + blank lines to decide whether a
file has any executable content; tombstones are stamped in the ledger
and skipped.
