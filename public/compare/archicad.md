# Kerf vs Graphisoft ArchiCAD

Graphisoft ArchiCAD (now owned by Nemetschek) invented Building Information Modelling (BIM) in 1987, before the term existed. It stores every building element — wall, slab, roof, door, window, stair — as a parametric object with properties (material, U-value, cost, fire rating), not just geometry. That data-richness is what distinguishes BIM from mere 3D drawing. ArchiCAD is used by architectural practices worldwide for everything from single-family homes to major public buildings. It is a domain-specific tool: it models buildings. Kerf is an engineering CAD tool that includes IFC support and structural grid primitives — it does not try to be a BIM authoring platform, but it can speak the same language.

## Where they converge

Both ArchiCAD and Kerf support IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) — the open standard for BIM data exchange. Kerf's IFC Tier 2 import means a building model authored in ArchiCAD can be brought into Kerf for coordination with structural engineering, MEP routing, or fabrication of specific components. Both tools produce parametric models: ArchiCAD's building elements have dimensional parameters; Kerf's mechanical features have sketch dimensions and feature parameters.

Both tools acknowledge that buildings include things other than architecture. ArchiCAD has MEP routing (Graphisoft MEP Modeler), structural grid, and coordination workflows; Kerf has a structural grid primitive, IFC import, and the ability to model the engineered components that go into a building — HVAC fittings, structural connections, facade panels — that a pure BIM authoring tool does not model with manufacturing precision.

## Where Kerf wins

- **Engineering fabrication precision.** ArchiCAD models buildings to architectural precision — a wall has a thickness and material, not a manufacturing tolerance. Kerf models to manufacturing precision: exact B-rep, GD&T-annotated drawings, flat-pattern sheet metal, and CNC-ready output. Facade contractors and structural fabricators who need to manufacture components from the model need Kerf, not ArchiCAD.
- **MIT open-core, no seat fee.** ArchiCAD licensing runs to thousands of dollars per seat per year (Solo and SME editions ~$180-250/mo as of May 2026; larger practice editions higher). Kerf is MIT-licensed — free locally.
- **Electronics and multi-domain.** ArchiCAD is buildings only. Kerf covers PCB schematic and layout, pre-compliance simulation, and mechanical engineering in the same workspace — relevant for smart building components, automation panels, and building-integrated electronics.
- **Chat-native workflow.** Describe a design change in plain language and the LLM edits the feature tree. ArchiCAD has no LLM interface we're aware of (as of May 2026).
- **Python scripting API.** Kerf exposes a kerf-sdk on PyPI for HTTP/JSON-RPC automation. ArchiCAD's scripting is GDL (Geometric Description Language) — a proprietary domain-specific language with a much steeper learning curve.

## Where ArchiCAD wins

- **Purpose-built BIM authoring.** ArchiCAD's wall tool, slab tool, roof generator, stair maker, curtain wall designer, and door/window library are purpose-built for architectural design. A wall knows it is a wall: it intersects cleanly with other walls, carries fire-rating data, and appears in a schedule automatically. Kerf has no equivalent domain objects.
- **IFC authoring depth.** ArchiCAD produces rich, property-set-complete IFC files where every element carries classification, material, cost, fire rating, and energy data. Kerf can import IFC Tier 2 but does not author IFC natively.
- **Energy analysis.** ArchiCAD exports to EnergyPlus and IDA ICE for building energy simulation via direct export. Kerf has no building energy analysis.
- **Documentation workflow.** ArchiCAD's integrated layout book, floor plan generation from the 3D model, section/elevation automation, and annotation system is designed for full architectural documentation packages. Kerf's drawing layer targets engineering technical drawings.
- **Teamwork (multi-user BIM).** ArchiCAD's Teamwork feature (BIMcloud) provides multi-user concurrent BIM authoring with element-level locking. Kerf's cloud collaboration is file-level (cloud git).

## Both speak IFC

ArchiCAD and Kerf both work with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes, ISO 16739). An ArchiCAD project exported to IFC can be imported into Kerf for engineering coordination — fabricating facade panels, modelling MEP components with manufacturing tolerance, or integrating building-embedded electronics. IFC is the handshake between the architect's BIM and the engineer's CAD model.
