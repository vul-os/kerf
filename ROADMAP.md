# Kerf — Roadmap

Strategy doc: **why / what / in what priority order.** The granular,
agent-executable backlog lives in [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) — keep the two in
sync when priorities move. The data-model + API spec is in
[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

Status glyphs — exactly three, everywhere in this doc:

## §1 — North Star, the LLM-native filter, the simplification principle

### North Star

**The most comprehensive CAD on Earth — a single tool in which a person can
design *anything*.** Mechanical engineering, electronics / PCB, architecture,
civil engineering, drafting, jewelry, automotive — **and every other CAD
sector, including the small and niche ones.** We are doing **everything**.
Nothing here is "cut." Lower priority means *later*, never *dropped*.

This is a **priority-ordered**, not date-ordered or effort-ordered, roadmap.
The tiers (P0→P3) express **sequence and leverage**, not a schedule and not an
estimate. Every item is committed and on the path; the order is simply which
ones earn the most credibility per unit of work.

Kerf is dual-licensed: the OSS core (MIT, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)) and the
hosted-tier code under `packages/kerf-{billing,cloud}/` + `src/cloud/`,
governed by [LICENSE-CLOUD](./LICENSE-CLOUD).

### The LLM-native filter (the spine of everything below)

Kerf is **chat-driven** CAD. The single design constraint that orders this
whole document:

> **Every capability must be LLM-editable through a text / parametric
> representation, and the result must be verifiable.**

The litmus test applied to *any* feature, shipped or proposed:

> *Can the LLM produce and re-edit this deliverable through a text-native
> tool, and verify the result?*

Every feature sorts into exactly one of:

- **Build** — there is no text representation yet. A real capability gap.
  This is where almost all of P0–P3 lives.
- **Simplify** — the capability is genuinely needed, but professional tools
  bury it under human-UX command-discovery complexity the LLM does not need.
  Ship the *capability* (parametric core + LLM tool + text schema +
  verification), not the *UI*.
- **Skip** — the thing exists *only* as a human authoring affordance and an
  LLM makes it redundant. This is a short, tightly-bounded list (§5) and it
  **never** applies to a sector or to a correctness/output/standards feature.

### Simplification principle

Professional CAD is overcomplicated mostly because of human
command-discovery affordances (ribbons, palettes, wizards, node graphs). An
LLM needs none of that. So Kerf ships professional **capability** while
deliberately *not* shipping professional **UI complexity**. This makes the
roadmap shorter than it looks: many "pro features" are UX wrappers around a
parametric core we either have or must build once, then expose as a text
schema + LLM tool + verifier.

**Hard guardrail:** "Simplify / Skip" is about *authoring mechanics only*. It
is never an excuse to drop a domain (§2/§3 — we do everything) or to skimp on
correctness/output/standards (GD&T, Gerber/fab output, DWG handoff,
verification). Those are *more* important under an LLM, not less, because the
LLM must be able to check its own work and hand off to the real world.

## §2 — Per-persona deliverable scorecard

<!-- Status reconciled 2026-05-16: ECAD fab output ✅; jewelry render ✅; mechanical sheet metal/weldments/GD&T ✅ (bend table T-4 still pending); architecture IFC Tier 2 + family editor ✅; DXF read+DWG bridge ✅; general DXF writer ✅ (T-7 shipped; DWG via ODA external). -->

Brutally honest. For each persona: the end deliverable they must ship, and
whether Kerf can produce it **text-natively today**.

Prioritization rationale = **AI-fit × societal importance × workforce size ×
Kerf-readiness** — this is why the P0 spine is electronics / mechanical /
drafting (high on all four today) and why civil, despite its high societal
importance, sits at P3: it is engine-gated, not low-value.

| Persona | End deliverable they must ship | Status | One-line gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mechanical engineer** | Parametric solid part / assembly + a dimensioned, GD&T-toleranced drawing + STEP | 🚧 partial | Strong core (OCCT features, sketcher, assemblies+mates, tolerance stack-up, linear/modal/thermal FEM, 3/5-axis CAM, TechDraw-flavored drawings *with* GD&T frames). Sheet metal flange/unfold/flat-pattern shipped; weldments + GD&T-from-model callouts shipped. **General DXF writer shipped** (T-7; DWG via ODA external). Remaining gap: **bend table** (T-4). |
| **Electronic engineer** | A *manufacturable* PCB: schematic → routed board → **fab package** | ✅ can manufacture | KiCad-class design (ERC, hier-schematic, net classes, shove router, autoroute/freerouting DSN, length tuning, via stitching, SPICE, RF, copper pour, imports KiCad libs) + **Gerber RS-274X, Excellon drill, pick-and-place, fab BOM, IPC-2581, ODB++ zip bundle** (`kerf_electronics.fab`) + 3D board STEP export for MCAD-ECAD co-design. |
| **Architect** | Coordinated building model → IFC + construction-doc drawings | 🚧 partial | `.bim` text-DSL → IFC4 (walls/slabs/spaces/levels/site, MEP, stairs/railings, curtain wall, schedules/views/sheets) + IFC import **Tier 1 + Tier 2** (openings/MEP/families/schedules) + parametric family editor shipped. **General DXF writer shipped** (T-7; DWG via ODA external). Missing: construction-doc detailing. |
| **Civil engineer** | Survey/terrain → alignment/corridor → grading + plan-and-profile sheets | 🔴 cannot | Essentially **nothing** civil-specific. Needs *distinct engines* (geospatial CRS, TIN/terrain, alignment/corridor solver, hydraulics, earthwork, LandXML/IFC-4.3-infra) — not feature-adds on the B-rep kernel. In the roadmap at **P3** with each engine named honestly — highest raw societal importance (water/sanitation/roads, esp. developing world); engine-gated, hence P3 not low-value. |
| **Drafter** | Multi-sheet 2D production drawing, exchanged as DWG/DXF | 🚧 partial | TechDraw-flavored drawings shipped (multi-sheet, dimensions, GD&T frames, section hatching, leaders/balloons, centerlines). **DXF reader + DWG bridge + general DXF writer all shipped** (`kerf_imports.dxf`, `dwg/bridge.py`, `kerf_imports.dxf_writer`; R12 + R2004). DWG output via ODA external (`dwg_note()`). Remaining gap: construction-doc detailing. |
| **Jewelry CAD designer** | Rendered/printable ring or setting with stones placed and metal-weight/cost | ✅ can render | Full toolkit shipped and wired: `kerf_cad_core.jewelry.{gemstones,gem_seat,settings,ring,metal_cost}` — 7 cuts, prong/bezel/channel/pavé/channel/pavé, US/UK/EU/JP sizer + 7 shank profiles, casting-cost, FeatureView inspectors, PBR gem/metal viewport materials, casting/STL production export, preset/template library, findings, chain/bracelet. OCCT JS worker `op*` handlers fully wired (`opGemstone`/`opGemSeat`/`opJewelryProngHead`/`opJewelryBezel`/`opJewelryChannel`/`opJewelryPave`/`opRingShank`). |
| **Automotive engineer** | Class-A bodyside / component + DMU + supplier exchange | 🔴 cannot | Transfers: NURBS surfacing, FEM, 5-axis CAM, zebra/reflection-line viz (shader-side, viewport toggle). **General DXF writer shipped** (T-7; DWG via ODA external). Gaps: BIW stamping bend table (T-4), 3D harness (2D WireViz only), crash/NVH/CFD/durability (FEM is linear-static/modal/thermal only), full-vehicle DMU. See [docs/plans/automotive.md](./docs/plans/automotive.md). |
| **Education / maker / hobbyist** | A printable / CNC-able functional part, enclosure, or furniture piece + cut list | 🚧 partial | Largest reach + strongest mission (democratizing design); 3D-print slicing (`packages/kerf-slicing`, CuraEngine) + 3/5-axis CAM (`packages/kerf-cam`) shipped. Needs the simple-parametric + cut-list / flat-pack path polished and a clear on-ramp. |

## §3 — Priority triage

Ordered by **leverage**, not time. Automotive cross-refs preserved inline.

### P0 — credibility blockers

<!-- Status reconciled 2026-05-16: P0-1 ✅ (gerber.py/excellon.py/pnp.py/ipc2581.py/odbpp shipped); P0-3 🔴→🚧 (T-1/T-2/T-3 done, T-4 bend table not done); P0-4 ✅ (boolean hardening + faceNamingT3Booleans corpus shipped). -->

A professional in the domain hits these in the first hour; their absence
disqualifies Kerf in minute one.

| # | Persona / sector | Capability | Status |

| P0-5 | Mechanical · Architect · **Automotive** | **Large-assembly performance ceiling** — measured budget + LOD / lazy-load for 1000s of parts. Automotive full-vehicle DMU (10,000s) is the extreme case. | 🔴 not started |

### P1 — depth that converts evaluators to users

<!-- Status reconciled 2026-05-16: P1-1 ✅ (board_step.py + kicad adapter shipped); P1-2 ✅ (all jewelry worker ops wired in occtWorker.js); P1-3 ✅ (weldment.py with cut list + gdt_callouts/ shipped); P1-4 ✅ (IFC Tier 2 openings/MEP/families/schedules + parametric family editor shipped). -->

| # | Persona / sector | Capability | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

### P2 — moats / breadth (tracked, not urgent)

Each is a solver-class or platform-class project; none blocks P0/P1.

- Nonlinear / explicit-dynamics (crash) / NVH / CFD / thermal-transient /
  fatigue-durability simulation (FEM is verified linear-static + modal +
  steady thermal + bonded contact only). Automotive simulation depth + EV
  packaging ride this line.
- Real-time multi-user collaboration.
- Cross-discipline clash detection.
- Scan-to-CAD / point-cloud / reverse engineering (cross-cutting, high
  leverage — touches mechanical, architecture, automotive, medical).
- Generative / lattice / DfAM (lattice partially via topology optimization).
- Robotics cell / kinematics / motion.
- Nesting / cut-optimization (laser / waterjet / plasma / sheet).
- GD&T / PMI model-based-definition + homologation documentation (shares the
  P1-3 "GD&T-from-model" gap).

### P3 — long-tail verticals & distinct-engine domains

**Everything else, all committed, lowest priority.** This is the proof that
"we do everything." Each line is a real domain on the path; many reuse the
parametric/partsgen spine, a few need distinct engines (named explicitly).

**Mechanical / product:** plastics & injection-mold tooling 🔴 · casting /
forging / die design 🔴 · packaging / dieline (folding carton, corrugated)
🔴 · springs / gears / cams generators 🔴 (kerf-partsgen-reachable) · piping
/ P&ID / plant design 🔴 · HVAC duct fabrication 🔴 · hydraulic / pneumatic
manifold 🔴.

**Electronics:** IC / VLSI layout 🔴 · power one-line / switchgear 🔴 ·
lighting / photometric 🔴 (cable/harness 3D tracked at P1-7).

**Architecture:** structural RC / steel + rebar 🔴 · interior /
space-planning / FF&E 🔴 · kitchen / bath / cabinetry / millwork 🔴 ·
landscape 🔴 · fire-protection / sprinkler 🔴 · scaffolding / formwork 🔴 ·
energy / daylight / acoustic 🔴.

**Civil / infrastructure (distinct engines, named):** geospatial CRS engine
🔴 · TIN terrain + contours + cut/fill 🔴 · horizontal/vertical alignment +
corridor solver 🔴 · hydraulics / stormwater 🔴 · grading / earthwork 🔴 ·
plan-and-profile sheet engine 🔴 · LandXML + IFC-4.3-infra I/O 🔴 ·
bridge/tunnel 🔴 · water/wastewater 🔴 · geotechnical 🔴 · mining 🔴 ·
marine/dredging 🔴 · rail signaling 🔴.

**Vehicles:** aerospace + composites ply/layup 🔴 · marine / naval-architecture
hull fairing 🔴 (close to Kerf's NURBS strength — relatively reachable) ·
rail rolling stock 🔴. (Automotive itself tracked at P1-6/P1-7/P2.)

**Body-worn / medical / craft:** watchmaking / horology 🔴
(partsgen-reachable) · eyewear / frames 🔴 · footwear / last design 🔴 ·
dental CAD (crowns / aligners) 🔴 · orthopedic / prosthetics / implants 🔴 ·
hearing aids 🔴. (Jewelry tracked at P1-2.)

**Soft goods (distinct 2D/developable engine):** apparel / pattern-making +
drape 🔴 · technical textiles / sails / membrane / tensile 🔴 · upholstery /
leather 🔴.

**Fabrication:** laser / waterjet / plasma + nesting 🔴 · woodworking /
furniture / joinery + cutlist 🔴 · robotics cell / kinematics 🔴. (Sheet
metal is P0-3; lattice/DfAM is P2; 3-print slicing + 3/5-axis CAM shipped.)

**Scientific / niche:** optical / lens / ray-trace 🔴 · microfluidics / MEMS
🔴 · wind-turbine / large-energy structures 🔴 · theatrical / stage / rigging
🔴 · signage / large-format 🔴.

**How to extend P3:** an uncovered sector is never "out of scope" — it is a
new line here plus one or more sized tasks in [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md). The
default home for a new sector is P3 unless it is a credibility blocker for an
existing persona (then P0/P1).

## §3.5 — Advanced cross-cutting capabilities (strategic AI-leverage)

These are not P3 filler. They are the **AI-native moat**: capabilities that
have no real equivalent in legacy CAD and that an LLM makes *more* powerful,
not less, because their substrate is **math, rules, or text** — exactly what a
chat-driven engine manipulates best. Each spans *every* sector simultaneously
(a simulation engine serves mechanical, automotive, civil, and aerospace at
once), so they compound leverage instead of adding it linearly. They are
**roadmap-level / strategic** and intentionally **not** yet decomposed into
[`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) tasks — they earn tasks only when a specific slice is
promoted to near-term P0/P1.

| Capability | Reference tools | Why it's AI-native / why it matters | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Implicit / function-rep (F-rep / SDF) modeling** | nTopology, ImplicitCAD | Field-driven lattices / TPMS / gradient materials. Geometry expressed as a math function is the *ideal* LLM substrate — no topology bookkeeping, infinitely composable, verifiable by sampling the field. Verified absent (no SDF/implicit/TPMS module). | 🔴 not started |
| **Generative / topology / multi-objective optimization (production-grade)** | Fusion Generative, nTop, OptiStruct | Manufacturing-constrained, multi-load-case, multi-objective, lattice-infill optimization. The LLM frames the objective + constraints in text and reads back a verified result. Verified: basic single-objective SIMP topo-opt shipped (`packages/kerf-topo`, FEniCSx); manufacturing constraints / multi-load / multi-objective / lattice-infill **not** — the deep, production-grade version is unbuilt. | 🚧 in flight |
| **Simulation pillar** *(user priority — emphasized)* | Abaqus, LS-DYNA, nCode, OpenFOAM / Ansys, Adams | Nonlinear FEA, explicit dynamics / crash, fatigue & durability, CFD, low/high-frequency EM, acoustics, multibody dynamics, coupled multiphysics. Physics is governing equations + boundary conditions = text; the LLM sets up the study and self-checks results. **Verified split:** `packages/kerf-fem` analysis enum is *exactly* `linear_static \| modal \| thermal` (+ bonded contact) → that slice ✅ shipped; **everything else — nonlinear, explicit/crash, fatigue, CFD, EM, acoustics, multibody, coupled multiphysics — is 🔴 not started.** | 🚧 in flight |
| **1D system simulation** | Modelica, Amesim, Simulink | Lumped-parameter thermal / hydraulic / electrical / control networks. Modelica is *text* — a declarative equation-based language — making this exceptionally AI-native. Verified absent. | 🔴 not started |
| **Manufacturing process simulation** | Moldflow, MAGMASOFT, AutoForm, Vericut | Mold-flow, casting solidification, stamping / forming, AM residual stress, machining (toolpath) verification, weld distortion. Closes the loop between design intent and a producible part the LLM can reason about. Verified absent. | 🔴 not started |
| **Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR)** | (re-parameterize imported "dumb" STEP into editable features) | Critical AI enabler: turns any imported boundary-rep solid into an editable parametric feature tree, so the LLM can edit *any* model — not just ones authored in Kerf. Verified absent (no feature-recognition module). | 🔴 not started |
| **Knowledge-based engineering / design automation / code-compliance** | KBE, DriveWorks | Engineering rules + standards checks (Eurocode / AISC / ACI / ASME / ISO) driven directly by the model. Rules and standards are *text* — extremely AI-native and a large differentiator. Verified absent as a general capability (only narrow PCB-DRC + railing checks exist). | 🔴 not started |
| **3D tolerance / variation analysis** | 3DCS, CETOL | Statistical stack-up + contributor analysis in 3D. Verified: 1D worst-case / RSS / Monte-Carlo stack-up shipped (`packages/kerf-mates` `tolerance.py`); **3D variation analysis 🔴 not started.** | 🚧 in flight |
| **PLM depth** | (product configurator, 150% / effectivity BOM, where-used, ECR / ECO, digital thread, MBSE / SysML traceability) | The digital thread is structured data + relationships = ideal for an LLM to traverse and keep coherent. Verified: file revisions + cloud git + configurations / variants + BOM rollup shipped (partial PLM); deep PLM (configurator, 150% / effectivity BOM, where-used, ECR/ECO, MBSE/SysML trace) **🔴 not started.** | 🚧 in flight |
| **Multi-CAD interop & geometry healing** | STEP AP242 / JT / Parasolid / QIF + automatic repair | Robust import/heal is what lets the LLM operate on the real-world ecosystem, not a walled garden. Verified: STEP I/O shipped; **AP242 / JT / Parasolid / QIF + automatic geometry healing 🔴 not started** (only internal ShapeFix passes inside surface booleans, not a general heal tool). | 🚧 in flight |
| **Reverse-engineering pipeline** | Geomagic, PolyWorks | Point cloud → segmentation → feature fit → parametric solid. Verified absent as a pipeline; quad-remesh (`packages/kerf-cad-core` `quad_remesh.py`) is an adjacent, reusable building block. | 🔴 not started |
| **Mechanism synthesis & motion** | MotionGen, Adams | Linkage / cam / gear-train *synthesis* + kinematics. Synthesis is an inverse problem stated in text (motion spec → mechanism) — very AI-native. Verified: mates constraint solver shipped (`packages/kerf-mates` `solver.py`); **mechanism synthesis 🔴 not started.** | 🚧 in flight |
| **Sustainability / LCA** | One Click LCA | Embodied-carbon / circularity computed straight from the model + a materials database. Data-native, increasingly *mandated* by regulation. Verified absent. | 🔴 not started |
| **Robotics / offline programming** | RoboDK, Process Simulate | Robot-cell simulation + path generation. Toolpaths and robot programs are text — naturally AI-native. Verified absent; 5-axis CAM (`packages/kerf-cam` `five_axis/`) is an adjacent, reusable path-gen base. | 🔴 not started |
| **Nesting / cut & material optimization** | (sheet / textile / wood / stone nesting) | Cross-cutting, high-leverage packing/optimization shared by laser/waterjet/plasma, woodworking, apparel, and stone — one solver serves many sectors. Verified absent. | 🔴 not started |

- **Cross-project parts (PCB-as-part)** ✅ — external_ref, lockfile,
  derived-artifact cache. → `docs/llm/cross_project.md`.
- **kerf-parts** ✅ — MIT-clean fetch/convert pipeline; kicad + freecad-library
  + bolts adapters all complete with tests (`test_bolts_freecad_adapters.py`,
  `test_kicad_adapter.py`).
- **kerf-partsgen** ✅ — author-once-then-enumerate standard-parts generator
  framework; 5 family generators shipped (ISO 4017 hex bolt, ISO 7089 flat
  washer, ISO 4762 socket-head cap screw, ISO 4032 hex nut, DIN 125 plain
  washer).

### Imports

## §5 — Deliberately NOT building (and why)

This list is **only** AI-redundant *authoring/UX interaction paradigms*. It
is **not** a list of skipped domains or skipped correctness features.

| Not building | Why (AI-native rationale) |
|---|---|
| Visual node programming (Grasshopper / Dynamo / Sverchok) | The LLM writing a parametric script *is* the graph. `.script.py` + the SDKs + JSCAD + the `.graph` data model already cover the value. |
| Ribbon / toolbar / command-palette maximalism | The LLM **is** the command palette — discovery is a chat sentence, not a menu hunt. |
| Macro recorders / scripting-GUI builders | The LLM **is** the macro author; it writes `.script.py` directly. |
| Gumball / direct-modeling maximalism | Keep a *basic* gumball; the LLM edits the feature tree. No need for the deep direct-modeling command surface. |
| In-app wizards / tutorials / onboarding tours | The chat **is** the wizard — context-specific guidance on demand. |

**Hard guardrail (restated):** this skip-logic applies *only* to
authoring/UX mechanisms. It **never** applies to (a) sectors/domains — all in,
see §2/§3 — or (b) correctness / output / standards features (GD&T,
Gerber/fab output, DWG handoff, verification/self-check), which are *more*
important under an LLM, not less.

## §6 — Long-term horizon (sectors — directional, NO tasks)

**Directional only.** Every sector here is fully **committed** ("we do
everything"), but it is deliberately **not** broken into [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md)
tasks until it is promoted to near-term P0/P1. This is the explicit parking
lot for sectors with **low near-term fit but high long-term value** —
distinct from P3, which already enumerates near-term-reachable long-tail
verticals. A sector graduates from §6 when an existing-persona credibility
need or a strategic bet pulls it forward; at that point it gets a P-tier line
in §3 and sized tasks in `tasks.md`.

| Sector | Reference tools | Long-term fit rationale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Textiles / apparel & technical-textile pattern-making** | CLO3D, Optitex, Gerber | One of the largest design workforces on earth. Needs a distinct 2D-pattern + cloth-drape engine; pattern-making is parametric (good eventual AI-fit), cloth drape simulation is the genuinely hard part. | 🔴 not started |
| **Composites engineering** | Fibersim, CATIA Composites | Ply-book / laminate / draping / fiber-steering. Spans aerospace, automotive, wind, and marine — high value, but a specialized layup engine. | 🔴 not started |
| **Medical / patient-specific** | Materialise Mimics / 3-matic | DICOM → surgical guides / orthotics / implants. High societal value and fast-growing; needs a medical-imaging-to-geometry pipeline. | 🔴 not started |
| **Process plant & pressure vessels** | AVEVA E3D, PV Elite, ISOGEN | Spec-driven piping / isometrics + ASME BPVC / PD5500 vessels. Huge industrial footprint; rule-native (good long-term AI-fit). | 🔴 not started |
| **Optical / photonics** | Zemax, PIC tools | Lens design + integrated optics. Math / parametric substrate → very AI-native long-term once the physics solvers exist. | 🔴 not started |

*Cross-reference (not duplicated here): civil sub-engines and marine /
naval-architecture hull fairing are already seeded at **P3 (§3)** because they
are nearer-term reachable; they are tracked there, not in this horizon table.*

## How to contribute

Pick a task from [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) (sized for a single isolated agent
run), or open an issue proposing a new P3 sector line. The roadmap states
*why* and *in what order*; `tasks.md` is the *how*. Keep them in sync: when a
priority moves here, move the corresponding tasks there.
