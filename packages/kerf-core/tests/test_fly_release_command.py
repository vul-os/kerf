"""Regression: fly.toml must run migrations in `[deploy] release_command`.

Without release_command, migrations land via `flyctl ssh console -C ...`
AFTER `flyctl deploy` returns. By then the new machine has already booted
its in-process workers (KERF_INPROCESS_WORKERS=true) and they immediately
poll fem_jobs / sim_jobs / step_tessellation_jobs / model_prices —
crashing with UndefinedTableError until the post-deploy migration step
catches up tens of seconds later. The git panel (and any other endpoint
reading from a yet-to-be-created table) returns 500 in that window.

This test pins the [deploy] block so a refactor can't silently regress.
