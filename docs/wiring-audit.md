# Backend Wiring Audit

Snapshot: 2026-05-19.  One row per backend capability.  "Frontend Status" describes
whether a browser-side module / UI panel actively calls the route or compute engine.

Legend:
- **Wired** — frontend module calls route / result is displayed in UI
- **Route exists, no UI** — HTTP endpoint exists but no frontend component consumes it
- **Partial** — some paths wired, others not
- **Bridge only** — JS bridge exists, no React component yet
- **No route** — computation lives in Python but no HTTP endpoint
- **Pending** — route returns `{status:"pending"}` (optional dep not installed)
