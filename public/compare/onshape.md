# Kerf vs Onshape

Onshape (PTC) pioneered cloud-native parametric CAD and remains the benchmark for real-time multi-user collaboration in design — the ability for multiple engineers to edit the same model simultaneously in a browser is genuinely unmatched. It introduced version-controlled Documents, FeatureScript for custom parametric features, and a growing App Store for simulation and rendering. Subscriptions start at ~US$1,500/yr (as of May 2026); the free tier allows public documents only. Kerf is the most natural peer comparison: cloud-friendly, browser-first, parametric. The honest picture is below.

## Where Onshape is strong

- **Real-time multi-user collaboration.** Onshape's defining capability: concurrent editing with live cursors and instant conflict resolution, all in the browser. No file locking, no "check out". This is genuinely ahead of any current Kerf collab offering.
- **True cloud-native architecture.** Purpose-built for the cloud from day one — no sync client, no save button, no version-mismatch between team members.
- **Built-in version control (Documents).** Branching, tagging, and history are first-class features baked into the platform — no separate Git integration needed.
- **FeatureScript ecosystem.** FeatureScript is a proprietary DSL, but it has produced a rich library of custom parametric features in the App Store, refined over years of community contribution.
- **Mobile and tablet editing.** Dedicated iOS and Android apps with full model editing — Kerf is a responsive browser experience without a native app.
- **Mature parametric CAD.** Part Studios with a decade of engineering behind them, a polished UI, and battle-tested reliability across complex industrial models.
- **Professional training and certification.** Onshape Learning Center, official certifications, and a large professional user base with extensive community content.

## Where Kerf differs

- **MIT open-core — no subscription, full offline.** Onshape requires a subscription starting at ~US$1,500/yr (as of May 2026); the free tier allows public documents only. Kerf is MIT-licensed — install the binary locally (brew/curl) for free, no account required, no connectivity needed, no revenue cap.
- **Open kernel, not a proprietary DSL.** Onshape extends via FeatureScript, a language PTC controls. Kerf's parametric DAG is backed by the MIT-licensed kernel directly — the extensibility surface is open.
- **Chat-native workflow with BYO LLM.** Describe a feature, constraint, or routing rule in plain language; the model edits the source backed by live doc-search. You can use Kerf's hosted models or bring your own API key — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Onshape has no LLM integration we're aware of (as of May 2026).
- **Multi-discipline: mechanical + electronics + jewelry.** Onshape is mechanical CAD. Kerf adds a full EDA stack (hierarchical schematic, shove router, SPICE, DRC, Gerber / IPC-2581) and a jewelry domain (ring v4, gemstones v2 — 30 cuts, settings, chain v2) in the same workspace.
- **620 analytic-oracle verified kernel tests.** The parametric and sketcher kernel ships with a verified test suite — results are checked against OCCT analytic ground truth.
- **kerf-sdk Python scripting (out-of-process).** HTTP/JSON-RPC from your own machine — the same interface the LLM uses internally.

## Honest gaps — where Kerf is behind today

- **Real-time collab maturity.** Onshape's concurrent multi-user editing is a decade in the making. Kerf's cloud collaboration feature is less mature. If live concurrent editing is critical, Onshape is ahead.
- **FeatureScript ecosystem.** Years of community-built FeatureScript features in Onshape's App Store have no Kerf equivalent today.
- **No mobile app.** Onshape's iOS and Android apps support editing on the go; Kerf is a responsive browser only.
- **Simulation ecosystem is smaller.** Neither platform ships first-party FEM, but Onshape's App Store has more mature simulation partner integrations available today.
- **Vendor polish and assembly depth.** Onshape's UI, mating system, and overall product finish reflect ten years of professional refinement. Kerf is younger.
- **Smaller community.** Onshape has a large, professionally-certified user base. Kerf's community is early-stage and growing.
