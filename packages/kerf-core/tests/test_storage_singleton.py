"""Regression: the storage singleton MUST be initialised at app startup.

Live dev 500 root cause: handlers call kerf_core.storage.get_storage_required()
(the module singleton), but _wire_storage() only set app.state.storage and
set_storage() was never called *anywhere*. So every storage-touching
endpoint — chat-with-parts, project thumbnails for ALL kinds, uploads,
derived artifacts — raised RuntimeError("Storage not initialized") → 500.

These pin: (1) get_storage_required raises only until set_storage, (2)
the app's storage-wiring path (_wire_storage + set_storage) makes it
usable, (3) app.py's _load_plugins still wires the singleton (source
guard so the call can't be silently dropped again).
