"""In-process worker co-location (single app = engine + workers).

Pins the contract behind the one-instance-group deploy:

  * _maybe_start_inprocess_workers is OFF unless KERF_INPROCESS_WORKERS
    is truthy, and never raises / never blocks app boot (returns None
    when disabled or when there is no DB pool).
  * InProcessWorkers runs the worker harness as background tasks and
    aclose() cleanly stops them — with NO OS signal handlers (uvicorn
    owns signals in the co-located process).
  * Zero configured workers is a clean no-op.

The separation path (standalone `python -m kerf_workers.runner`) shares
_build_workers() with the in-process path, so this also guards against
the two diverging.
