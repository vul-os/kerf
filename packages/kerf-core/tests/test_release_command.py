"""Regression: migration runner CLI must accept DATABASE_URL env fallback.

The pre-deploy migration step in fly.toml (`release_command`) relies on the
runner reading the DSN from the environment — it can't inject secrets directly
into the command string. We moved migrations into this pre-deploy hook to
fix the race where in-process workers booted and crashed on UndefinedTableError
(fem_jobs / sim_jobs / step_tessellation_jobs / model_prices) before a
post-deploy manual migration step could land.

To support that, the runner now reads from argv[1] OR $DATABASE_URL.
This test pins both behaviours and is host-agnostic.
