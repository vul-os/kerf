"""
kerf_core.revisions — canonical write_revision / reconstruct_revision.

Improvements shipped in Phase 4:
  - Real unified diffs for 'diff' rows (not duplicate full content).
  - SHA-256 dedup: skip inserting when hash matches latest base or diff.
  - Safe cap-pruning: never delete a row that is a parent_revision_id for
    a younger row (would break diff-chain reconstruction).
  - gzip stored as raw bytea via content_codec='gzip' (new rows only);
    legacy base64-text rows (content_codec='plain') still decode correctly.

Improvements shipped in Phase 5:
  - Cross-file hash dedup (migration 049_revision_content_ref.sql):
    if any existing 'base' row in the table has the same content_sha256,
    the new revision is stored as a 'ref' row pointing to that base via
    parent_revision_id.  No content payload is stored; reconstruction
    follows the pointer.
  - reconstruct_revision: 'ref' rows are followed via parent_revision_id
    to retrieve the shared base content.
  - Safe pruning extended: never delete a 'base' row that is pointed to
    by live 'ref' rows elsewhere in the table.

The 'diff' rows store a unified-diff of the *decoded* parent content vs
the new content. Reconstruction walks up to the nearest base, then applies
diffs in order. Chain length is capped at REBASE_THRESHOLD — once that
many diffs accumulate since the last base, the next write is promoted to
a new base row.
