"""Compatibility shims for running kerf_electronics tools outside of the legacy backend.

Provides poison-proof local definitions of ``ToolSpec``, ``Tool``, ``Registry``,
``register``, ``ok_payload`` and ``err_payload``. We deliberately do NOT
delegate to ``kerf_chat.tools.registry`` for the *types* here: that module is
sometimes monkey-patched by sibling test files (e.g. test_site.py replaces
``ToolSpec`` with a stub that swallows all keyword arguments), and any
module that imports the canonical ToolSpec after that replacement would
pick up the broken class and fail at attribute access. By keeping a
self-contained dataclass here the electronics modules remain robust to that
test-time pollution while still emitting tool specifications that are
structurally identical to the canonical kerf_chat ones.

``register`` does still co-operate with ``kerf_chat.tools.registry`` when
that module is loaded — registrations are mirrored into the canonical
``Registry`` list so the legacy plugin loader keeps working — and into
``register`` stubs installed by individual test files (so tests that
introspect registered tools via a sys.modules-replaced registry continue
to see our registrations).
