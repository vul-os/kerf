# Testing Breakdown Manifest — system-health phase

Single source of truth for the hardening pass. Subsequent sonnet agents pull one task
at a time, isolate it in a worktree, ship a green PR, mark the checkbox.

Ground rules for every task:

- Hermetic (no network, no external binaries). Mock SMTP, mock OCCT worker
  where unavoidable, mock outbound HTTP. Postgres tests must use the `pc`
  local role and an ephemeral schema/database per session.
- One commit per task: `test(<area>): <one-line summary>`.
- Minimum case counts below are floors — overshoot if the surface area
  warrants it. Cases should target real failure modes (boundaries,
  malformed input, idempotency, cross-tenant isolation), not just happy
  path.
- All test files live next to the package they exercise; new top-level
  pytest collections only when the parent package owns no test dir.

## Section 1 — Per-feature integration tests

Each task wires a *user-facing feature* end-to-end (chat → tool dispatch →
plugin call → worker / pure-python compute → render or export round-trip),
not a single internal module. ≥25 hermetic cases each unless otherwise
noted.

## Section 4 — Frontend E2E (Playwright)

Persona-scoped flows the chat agent must never break. Build on existing
`tests/e2e/specs/` patterns and `tests/e2e/pages/` page objects. Each
spec runs against a seeded dev server with mocked Anthropic and a clean
Postgres schema. ≥10 user-visible assertions per spec.

- [ ] T-95 E2E jewelry persona
  Scope: signup → new jewelry project → chat "design a 6-prong solitaire 1ct round D-VVS1 platinum size 6" → render → STL export.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_jewelry.spec.ts`
  Success: SKU built; PBR materials applied; cost panel populated; STL downloads & is manifold.

- [ ] T-96 E2E mechanical persona
  Scope: signup → new mech project → import FreeCAD fixture → chat "add 4 M4 holes on top face" → unfold sheet metal → drawing → PDF.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_mech.spec.ts`
  Success: feature tree shows hole pattern; unfold succeeds; drawing dimensions auto; PDF export downloads.

- [ ] T-97 E2E ECAD persona
  Scope: signup → new electronic project → import KiCad fixture → chat "run DRC + generate Gerbers + BOM" → fab zip.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_ecad.spec.ts`
  Success: DRC report shown; Gerber zip downloads; BOM table renders; cost roll-up against mocked distributors.

- [ ] T-98 E2E architect persona
  Scope: signup → new arch project → space program from chat → IFC export → import back.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_architect.spec.ts`
  Success: spaces visible in 3D; IFC export valid; round-trip preserves spaces & GlobalIds.

- [ ] T-99 E2E civil persona
  Scope: signup → new civil project → alignment + earthwork from chat → cut/fill report → DXF export.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_civil.spec.ts`
  Success: alignment renders; earthwork volumes match expected within 2%; DXF downloads.

- [ ] T-100 E2E automotive persona (composites + clash)
  Scope: signup → new mech/auto project → assembly load → composites layup + clash check → report.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_automotive.spec.ts`
  Success: clash report lists expected interferences; composites layup table renders; export OK.

- [ ] T-101 E2E billing flow (paid bucket)
  Scope: free user → upgrade simulated → consume usage → invoice line items appear → BETA-mode toggle hides billing UI but features remain.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_billing.spec.ts`
  Success: usage tally matches API; BETA flag hides Pricing route; features still available.

- [ ] T-102 E2E share-link viewer
  Scope: owner creates viewer share-link → second browser opens → cannot mutate → expiry observed.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_share_link.spec.ts`
  Success: viewer sees project; mutate UI disabled; expired token redirects to login.

- [ ] T-103 E2E workshop publish
  Scope: complete project → publish to workshop → gallery shows → like → README renders.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_workshop.spec.ts`
  Success: gallery card has primary image; README markdown safe-rendered; like count increments.

- [ ] T-104 E2E chat regression matrix
  Scope: chat agent does NOT silently break the editor — 10 representative tool calls (sketch / feature / sheet-metal / weldment / drawing / PCB / jewelry / arch / FEM / CAM) each leave the project re-openable.
  File: `tests/e2e/specs/persona_chat_regression.spec.ts`
  Success: after each tool call: project list refresh, reopen, last revision restorable, no orphan jobs.
