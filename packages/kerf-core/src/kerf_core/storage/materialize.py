"""Git-as-substrate core write-loop (T-124).

This module is the keystone that turns a project's in-memory file set into a
real git commit, transparently offloading large/binary files to the shared
content-addressed object store while keeping diff-able source inline.

The pipeline, per file, is:

  1. classify  — ``kerf_core.storage.classify.should_store_as_blob`` decides
     blob-vs-inline (size dominates; non-UTF-8 is always a blob). The
     threshold defaults to ``settings.git_inline_max_bytes``.
  2. blob path — compute ``sha256`` of the raw bytes (the *oid*), write the
     bytes to the object-storage backend under a content-addressed key
     (``blobs/<oid[:2]>/<oid>`` — idempotent: same content → same key, so
     forks share objects for free), record the oid in the dedup ledger
     (``blob_objects`` + ``blob_refs``), and place the **canonical Git-LFS v1
     pointer** (``lfs_pointer.serialize``) into the git tree at the file path.
  3. inline path — the file's exact bytes go into the git tree verbatim.
  4. commit — assemble the tree (nested dirs preserved) and commit it into a
     per-project **bare** git repository via ``pygit2``.

It deliberately reuses the existing seams (``classify``, ``lfs_pointer``,
``db.queries.blob_objects``, the ``Storage`` backend, ``pygit2``) rather than
inventing a parallel mechanism.

INTEGRATION NOTE (left intentionally out of this slice)
-------------------------------------------------------
The live cloud-git commit handler ``POST /projects/{pid}/git/commit`` in
``packages/kerf-cloud/src/kerf_cloud/routes.py`` currently records a *synthetic*
random sha into ``cloud_git_commits`` and never builds a real tree. Wiring
``materialize_and_commit`` into that handler also requires resolving where each
project's bare repo lives on disk / in S3 (``S3GitStorer`` prefix
``workspaces/{pid}/git``) and threading the storage backend + db connection
through the request — that touches the S3 sync + concurrency-marker path owned
by adjacent waves (T-125). To keep this slice landable and well-tested, the
write-loop is delivered here as a standalone, fully-tested service function;
the handler integration is a one-call substitution
(``sha = await materialize_and_commit(...)``) once the repo-location seam from
T-125 lands. Read-back is provided by ``read_path`` for round-trip tests and
for the future ``kerf export --hydrate`` path.
