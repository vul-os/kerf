"""Concrete GitReachabilityOracle backed by real pygit2 bare repos (T-150).

Walk every commit reachable from every branch and tag in the project's bare
git repository.  For each commit, scan its tree for blob objects whose content
parses as an LFS pointer that encodes the queried oid.  If found in *any*
commit across *all* history, the oid is considered reachable — GC must not
reclaim it.

Safety contract (mirrors the Protocol doc-string):
  - False negatives are FORBIDDEN.  The oracle only returns False when it has
    positively confirmed that no reachable commit references the oid.
  - False positives are safe — they merely delay GC.
  - Any IO error during the walk causes the oracle to return True (safe side).

Execution model
---------------
``is_oid_reachable`` is synchronous so it can be called from ``BlobGCWorker``
without await.  The pygit2 walk is CPU/IO-bound and should be invoked from a
thread-pool executor when called from async code (the worker's ``_tick`` is
already sync for the oracle call path, but the caller can also wrap this in
``asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, oracle.is_oid_reachable, oid)``
for non-blocking usage if needed).

Repo location
-------------
The oracle receives a ``repo_dir`` — the filesystem path of the bare git repo.
For a ``LocalStorage`` deployment this is resolved via
``kerf_core.storage.git_storer.resolve_project_repo``; for a ``LocalStorage``
test, callers pass the path directly.  The oracle is intentionally
repo-per-instance so it is lightweight to construct and test.
