# Kerf vs PTC Creo

PTC Creo (formerly Pro/ENGINEER) invented parametric feature-based solid modelling in 1988 and has shaped how the entire CAD industry thinks about design intent, feature trees, and bidirectional associativity. It remains one of the most widely used mechanical CAD platforms in manufacturing, with particular strength in sheet metal, piping, and model-based definition (MBD). Creo Parametric is PTC's flagship; the platform extends to Creo Simulate (FEM), Creo Illustrate, and Creo View. Pricing is enterprise-level. Kerf is the MIT-licensed alternative for teams doing serious parametric mechanical work without the subscription.

## Where they converge

Both Creo and Kerf are built on parametric B-rep feature trees with constraint-based sketchers. Both produce associative drawings (change the model, the drawing updates). Both treat geometric precision as non-negotiable — tolerances, manufacturing constraints, and GD&T are first-class, not bolt-ons. Both handle sheet metal as a genuine manufacturing workflow: flanges, bends, unfold, flat pattern, and DXF export.

Both tools also acknowledge multi-disciplinary reality. Creo spans mechanical, simulation, technical illustration, and AR/VR output; Kerf spans mechanical, electronics, scripting, and a cloud collaboration layer. The ambition to cover the full engineering workflow — not just geometry — is shared.

## Where Kerf wins

- **MIT open-core, no subscription.** Creo Parametric starts at thousands of dollars per seat per year (as of May 2026) and escalates quickly with modules (Simulate, Advanced Assembly, Surfacing). Kerf's full feature set is MIT-licensed — free locally, no seat fee, no module gating.
- **Chat-native workflow.** Describe a design change in plain language and the LLM edits the feature tree, backed by live doc-search so it does not hallucinate API surface. No LLM interface in Creo has shipped to our knowledge (as of May 2026).
- **In-box electronics.** Creo is a mechanical tool. Kerf ships PCB schematic, layout, pre-compliance simulation (SI/EMC/PDN/thermal), and full fab output without extension gating. For hardware products that include a PCB, Kerf is a single workspace.
- **Single-binary install, all platforms.** A brew or curl install on macOS, Windows, or Linux gives a fully functional offline binary. Creo requires Windows and a PTC FlexNet licence server.
- **BYO LLM key.** Bring your own Anthropic or OpenAI API key via the `kerf_byo` bucket. We're not aware of any configurable AI interface in Creo (as of May 2026).

## Where Creo wins

- **Decades of field validation.** Pro/ENGINEER and its successors have powered real production manufacturing for 35+ years. The feature modelling reliability, fillets-on-fillets handling, and large-assembly performance have been hardened against real-world failure modes that Kerf's younger kernel has not encountered.
- **Creo Simulate (Mechanica).** Built-in structural, thermal, and fatigue FEM with h-element adaptive meshing — a mature simulation capability Kerf does not ship.
- **Piping and cabling.** Creo Piping and Cabling workbenches route rigid pipe, flex hose, and electrical harnesses within the assembly model. Kerf has no equivalent.
- **Model-based definition (MBD).** Creo GD&T Advisor and 3D annotation planes produce fully annotated 3D models for paperless manufacturing — a standard Kerf's drawing layer does not yet match in depth.
- **Large-assembly performance.** Creo has been engineered to handle assemblies of thousands of components in simplified representation mode. Kerf's assembly layer is newer.

## Both produce STEP

Creo and Kerf both export ISO 10303 STEP (AP214 / AP242). STEP is the universal handshake in mechanical CAD. Geometry produced in Creo can be imported into Kerf for downstream PCB integration, scripted analysis, or cloud collaboration — and vice versa.
