# AFR — Automatic Feature Recognition

Re-parameterize an imported "dumb" B-rep into an ordered, editable feature tree using an
Attribute-Adjacency-Graph (AAG) algorithm.  Pure Python, no OCC dependency.  Never raises.

## Entrypoints

### `recognize_features(topology) -> dict`

Main entry point.  Accepts a B-rep topology dict **or** a triangle-mesh cluster dict.

**B-rep topology input schema:**
```json
{
  "faces": [
    {
      "id": "<str|int>",
      "type": "planar|cylindrical|conical|spherical|toroidal|other",
      "normal": [nx, ny, nz],
      "radius": 0.0,
      "area": 0.0,
      "convexity": "convex|concave|flat",
      "adjacent": ["<face_id>", ...]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "<str|int>",
      "face_a": "<face_id>",
      "face_b": "<face_id>",
      "convexity": "convex|concave|tangent",
      "length": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

**Mesh-cluster input schema** (alternative):
```json
{
  "vertices": [[x,y,z], ...],
  "triangles": [[i,j,k], ...],
  "face_clusters": [
    {
      "id": "<int>",
      "type": "planar|cylindrical|...",
      "normal": [nx,ny,nz],
      "radius": 0.0,
      "area": 0.0,
      "convexity": "convex|concave|flat",
      "adjacent": [<cluster_id>, ...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "<feature_type>",
      "params": {},
      "face_ids": [],
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "feature_tree": [
    { "type": "<feature_type>", "index": 0 }
  ],
  "reason": "recognized 3 feature(s) from 12 face(s)"
}
```

Never raises — returns `{"ok": false, "features": [], "feature_tree": [], "reason": "<msg>"}` on error.

## Supported feature types

| Feature | Detection strategy | Confidence range |
|---|---|---|
| `through_hole` | Concave cylinder, no floor cap | 0.85–0.90 |
| `blind_hole` | Concave cylinder + 1 planar cap parallel to axis | 0.87 |
| `counterbore` | Two coaxial concave cylinders of different radii + shared step face | 0.82 |
| `countersink` | Conical face + optional coaxial inner cylinder | 0.80 |
| `pocket` | Concave closed face loop with planar floor | 0.78 |
| `slot` | Pocket whose floor bbox aspect ratio ≥ 3 | 0.75 |
| `boss` | Convex cylindrical protrusion above a base face | 0.80 |
| `fillet` | Toroidal face, or small-radius cylinder tangent to ≥2 planar neighbours | 0.82–0.90 |
| `chamfer` | Planar face whose normal is 30–60° to ≥2 adjacent face normals | 0.72 |
| `rib` | Convex planar face with ≥2 concave-edge neighbours | 0.65 |
| `step` | Pair of coplanar faces separated by a perpendicular riser | 0.70 |

Feature tree order: base → boss/rib (additive) → pocket/slot → holes → fillets → chamfers.

## LLM tool names

`afr_recognize_features` — classify a topology/mesh dict into features.  Accepts a `topology` dict.

`afr_to_parametric` — promote classifier output into a replay-able parametric DAG.  Accepts
`topology` (same dict) + `features` (the list from `afr_recognize_features`) + optional `name`.
Returns `{ok, feature_log, dag_summary, reason}` where `feature_log` is a `.feature` JSON dict
that can be re-parsed and re-executed.

## Usage snippets

```python
# Two-step: classify → DAG → .feature log
from kerf_cad_core.afr.recognize import recognize_features
from kerf_cad_core.afr.dag import afr_to_dag, emit_feature_log

topology = {
    "faces": [
        {"id": 0, "type": "planar", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 0, "area": 400,
         "convexity": "flat", "adjacent": [1], "centroid": [10,10,5]},
        {"id": 1, "type": "cylindrical", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 5, "area": 314,
         "convexity": "concave", "adjacent": [0], "centroid": [10,10,2.5]},
    ]
}
result = recognize_features(topology)
dag = afr_to_dag(topology, result["features"])
# dag.topological_order() → ["afr-base", "afr-through_hole-0"]
# dag.parent_of("afr-through_hole-0") → "afr-base"
log = emit_feature_log(topology, result["features"], name="my-step-import")
# log["features"][0]["op"] == "box"          (base block)
# log["features"][1]["op"] == "cylinder"     (through-hole)
```

```python
from kerf_cad_core.afr.recognize import recognize_features

topology = {
    "faces": [
        {"id": 0, "type": "planar", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 0, "area": 100,
         "convexity": "flat", "adjacent": [1,2,3,4]},
        {"id": 1, "type": "cylindrical", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 5, "area": 94.25,
         "convexity": "concave", "adjacent": [0]},
    ]
}
result = recognize_features(topology)
# result["features"][0]["type"] == "through_hole"
# result["features"][0]["params"]["diameter"] == 10.0
```

```python
# Mesh-cluster path (from a segmented STL)
topology = {
    "vertices": [...],
    "triangles": [...],
    "face_clusters": [
        {"id": 0, "type": "planar", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 0, "area": 200,
         "convexity": "flat", "adjacent": [1]},
        {"id": 1, "type": "cylindrical", "normal": [0,0,1], "radius": 8, "area": 150,
         "convexity": "concave", "adjacent": [0]},
    ]
}
result = recognize_features(topology)
```

## Caveats

- Confidence values are heuristic; counterbore detection requires the shared step face to be
  explicitly listed in both cylinders' `adjacent` lists.
- Slot vs pocket classification uses `face.bbox` (optional); falls back to area heuristic.
- Rib detection has the lowest confidence (0.65) — validate results before machining ops.
- `edges` list is optional but improves fillet/chamfer accuracy.
