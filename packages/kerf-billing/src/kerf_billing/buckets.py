"""Three-bucket billing model.

Every chat token is paid for by EXACTLY ONE of:

- ``kerf_free``  — free-tier monthly quota.  Cheap-tier models only.  We
  still record COGS in usage_events so we can see the burn.
- ``kerf_paid``  — pre-paid credits.  Any model.  20% markup over COGS.
- ``byo_<provider>``  — user's own API key.  Zero billing.  Tokens still
  recorded so the user can see them on the dashboard.

The selector is a pure function: given the user's state and an estimated
cost, it returns a tagged Bucket value (or an InsufficientCredits sentinel).
Side effects (decrementing balance / quota, inserting usage_events) are
the caller's job and live in :mod:`kerf_billing.spend`.

The caller MUST commit token usage + balance/quota deduction inside a
single SQL transaction so they can't drift.  See ``spend.commit_spend``.
