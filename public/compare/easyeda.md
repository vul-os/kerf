# Kerf vs EasyEDA

EasyEDA (now EasyEDA Pro) is a browser-based PCB design tool owned by JLCPCB and LCSC Electronics. It is free, requires no installation, runs entirely in a browser, and is deeply integrated with JLCPCB's one-click ordering and LCSC's component database. For the maker, student, and budget-conscious startup, EasyEDA eliminates every barrier between having an idea and ordering a PCB. It has grown to millions of users. EasyEDA Pro is a more capable native-app version launched in 2022. Kerf targets the same user profile but raises the ceiling significantly: pre-compliance simulation, richer fab output, MIT licensing, mechanical CAD in the same workspace, and a chat-native interface.

## Where they converge

Both EasyEDA and Kerf are browser-capable PCB tools targeting makers, startups, and engineers who want to get a PCB made without an expensive seat licence. Both support schematic capture → PCB layout → Gerber export → direct JLCPCB ordering (Kerf via Gerber export; EasyEDA via native one-click). Both have component libraries (EasyEDA's LCSC-backed library is very large; Kerf's is growing).

Both tools acknowledge that getting the PCB manufactured is the goal — not just modelling it. Both produce Gerber and NC drill files. Both are accessible to users who are not full-time PCB designers: EasyEDA through extreme simplicity; Kerf through a chat-native interface that describes what you want rather than requiring deep knowledge of routing rules.

## Where Kerf wins

- **Pre-compliance simulation, in-box.** EasyEDA has basic DRC and no simulation beyond SPICE (limited). Kerf ships signal integrity (transmission-line, via stub, differential pair), EMC/EMI analysis (common-mode, return-path gap, slot antenna), PDN analysis (decap placement, target impedance, plane resonance), and PCB thermal (copper pour, via relief, hot-spot) — all without extension gating or additional cost.
- **MIT open-core, no proprietary cloud lock-in.** EasyEDA is proprietary and cloud-hosted — your projects live on EasyEDA's servers. Kerf is MIT-licensed with a local binary option; you own your data.
- **Richer fab output.** Kerf exports Gerber, Excellon, IPC-2581, ODB++, and IPC-D-356A netlist. EasyEDA exports Gerber and NC drill; IPC-2581 and ODB++ are not available.
- **MCAD/ECAD integration.** EasyEDA has a 3D preview (basic) but no mechanical CAD integration. Kerf is co-resident mechanical + PCB: the board outline is the same geometry as the mechanical enclosure, with IDF and STEP export for the complete MCAD/ECAD handoff.
- **Chat-native workflow.** Describe a routing rule, a via stack, or a schematic change in plain language and the LLM edits the PCB/schematic source. EasyEDA has no LLM interface we're aware of (as of May 2026).

## Where EasyEDA wins

- **Zero install, zero cost.** EasyEDA runs in any browser with no account required for basic use. The LCSC component library is enormous and free. Ordering from JLCPCB is one click. For a student or hobbyist, this is the fastest path from idea to PCB.
- **JLCPCB / LCSC integration.** EasyEDA is owned by the same company as JLCPCB and LCSC. Component footprints are verified against LCSC stock; BOM export maps directly to LCSC part numbers; one-click JLCPCB ordering pre-fills the order with the correct Gerber settings. This vertical integration is unmatched.
- **LCSC component library.** Millions of components with verified footprints, 3D models, LCSC stock numbers, and pricing. Kerf's library is growing but does not have this depth.
- **Community scale.** Millions of users, an active forum, and thousands of public shared projects on EasyEDA's platform. Kerf is early-stage.
- **EasyEDA Pro native app.** EasyEDA Pro (2022+) is a native desktop app with a more powerful router and larger board support. It is still free.

## Both produce Gerber for JLCPCB

EasyEDA and Kerf both produce Gerber RS-274X and Excellon NC drill files. Any PCB that can be ordered on JLCPCB from EasyEDA Gerbers can equally be ordered from Kerf Gerbers — the fab file format is identical. Kerf additionally exports IPC-2581 (the next-generation unified data format) and ODB++ for higher-end fabs, but Gerber-to-JLCPCB works identically.
