"""Regression: activity-feed attribution columns are folded into baseline.

Every chat event in the activity panel used to render as "Unknown
asked …" / "Unknown created the project" because:
  - `chat_messages` had no `user_id` column
  - `chat_threads` had no `created_by` column
  - `projects` had no `created_by` column

These were folded into the consolidated baseline migration
(0001_core_identity.sql) per the "clean baseline migrations" rule —
NOT introduced via an `alter table … add column` shim, since DBs are
reset on deploy.

This test pins the DDL so a refactor can't silently strip the columns
again (the activity SQL joins through them and the route would 500 if
they're missing).
