"""Idempotent SQL migration runner.

Applied `*.sql` files are recorded in `kerf_migrations_ledger` (a
filename-keyed table — deliberately NOT `schema_migrations`, which some
legacy/ORM tooling already owns with a different schema).

Each unseen migration is applied in its own transaction then stamped.
For databases that were already built by an earlier (non-idempotent)
run, re-applying a migration raises a duplicate-object error — that's
treated as "already applied": the error is swallowed and the file is
stamped, so genuinely-new migrations still run while old ones don't
re-execute. Real (non-duplicate) errors still abort the deploy.
