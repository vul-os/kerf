# License

Kerf is open-source software. You can read, modify, and redistribute the entire
codebase — including the bits that power our hosted service — under the MIT
license.

## TL;DR

You can:

- **Use Kerf for anything**, including commercial work, with no fee.
- **Modify it.** Fork the repo, change what you want, ship your version.
- **Redistribute it.** Bundle Kerf into your own product, or run it as a
  service for your customers.
- **Sell it.** You don't owe us a cut. Charge whatever you like.
- **Self-host the cloud.** The code that runs `kerf.app` is in the same public
  repo, under the same license. If you want to operate your own hosted Kerf,
  you can.

You have to:

- **Keep the copyright notice and license text** in any copy or substantial
  portion of the software you distribute.

That's it.

## Third-party components

Kerf depends on a number of open-source libraries — three.js, JSCAD, OpenCascade
(via opencascade.js), planegcs, tscircuit, React, Tailwind, and others. Each
ships under its own license (mostly MIT, Apache 2.0, or LGPL). Their license
texts travel with the source in `node_modules/` and the compiled bundles. Run
`npm ls` in a checkout to see the full list.

## A note on intent

The MIT license is short on purpose. We picked it because we want Kerf to be
useful — to hobbyists, to small shops, to companies, to other tools that want
to embed parametric CAD. If you find yourself wishing the license said more,
chances are MIT already lets you do the thing.

If you're unsure whether a particular use is allowed: it almost certainly is.
If you'd like to talk anyway, drop us a line at the contact address in
[Privacy](/docs/privacy) or [Terms](/docs/terms).
